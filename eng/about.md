I am a Full Professor at the University of Poitiers, working within the Ecology, Evolution, Symbiosis (EES) team at the [Ecology and Biology of Interactions Laboratory (EBI)](https://ebi.labo.univ-poitiers.fr). My work is in the field of conservation biology and population genetics, using integrated approaches ranging from population genetics to environmental DNA.

My research aims to describe and understand the genetic structure of animal populations and to assess the impact of human activities and natural processes on biodiversity, particularly in crayfish, iguanas and newts. I am also interested in the interactions between invasive and native species, combining experimental, omics and ecological approaches.

I coordinate or participate in several national and international projects on the conservation of native crayfish, environmental monitoring through metabarcoding, and the genomic evolution of symbiosis.
