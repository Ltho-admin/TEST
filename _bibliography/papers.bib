  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

    abstract = {European crayfish are sensitive to the crayfish plague pathogen, Aphanomyces astaci, carried by North American crayfish species due to their less effective immune defence mechanisms against this disease. During a controlled infection experiment with a susceptible crayfish species Astacus astacus using three A. astaci strains (representing genotype groups A, B, and E), we investigated variation in their virulence and in crayfish immune defence indicators (haemocyte density, phenoloxidase activity, and production of reactive oxygen species). Experimental crayfish were exposed to two dosages of A. astaci spores (1 and 10 spores mL(-1)). The intensity and timing of the immune response differed between the strains as well as between the spore concentrations. Stronger and faster change in each immune parameter was observed in crayfish infected with two more virulent strains, indicating a relationship between crayfish immune response and A. astaci virulence. Similarly, the immune response was stronger and was observed earlier for the higher spore concentration. For the first time, the virulence of a strain of the genotype group E (isolated from Orconectes limosus) was experimentally tested. Total mortality was reached after 10 days for the two higher spore dosages (10 and 100 spores mL(-1)), and after 16 days for the lowest (1 spore mL(-1)), revealing equally high and rapid mortality as caused by the genotype group B (from Pacifastacus leniusculus). No mortality occurred after infection with genotype group A during 60 days of the experimental trial.},

	abstract = {The redclaw crayfish, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Cherax quadricarinatus,{\textless}i/{\textgreater} was introduced to Martinique Island for aquaculture purposes in 2004, in an attempt to revitalize the freshwater crustacean aquaculture sector. In 2015, three wild populations were discovered during an electrofishing survey on fish diversity. In 2018, a specific crayfish survey was performed at night using spotlighting and baited traps at 34 sites throughout the island. The species was mostly found in the center and northern part of the island, specifically, a total of 105 specimens were captured in eight streams and five closed water bodies. We sequenced a 491 base-pair fragment of the COI gene to understand the invasion history and pathway from the presumed source population at the Mangatal hatchery. Among the eight haplotypes found, three were dominant, of which, two occurred in the Mangatal hatchery. As crayfish are sold alive, there is a high risk of further human-mediated introductions across the island hydrographic basins. Thus, the distribution of this species could rapidly expand throughout Martinique freshwater ecosystems, with ecological impacts on native communities yet to be determined and requiring urgent investigation.},

Both the minimum evolution tree with the HKY85 model and the maximum likelihood analysis supports the separation of two major clades (A and B) and three clades within clade A. The two major groups A and B showed genetic differentiation of 4.6\% and could be in accordance with the classification on the specific status of A. italicus and A. pallipes. Within clade A, three clades were found corresponding to crayfish sampled in Spain-Italy-France, Austria, and Slovenia. In accordance with morphological data extracted from recent papers, a new classification based on the presence of three subspecies (italicus, carinthiacus, and carsicus) within A. italicus is proposed.},

	abstract = {The worldwide increase of hybridization in different groups is thought to have become more important with the loss of isolating barriers and the introduction of invasive species. This phenomenon could result in the extinction of endemic species. This study aims at investigating the hybridization dynamics between the endemic and threatened Lesser Antillean iguana (Iguana delicatissima) and the invasive common green iguana (Iguana iguana) in the Lesser Antilles, as well as assessing the impact of interspecific hybridization on the decline of I. delicatissima. 59 I. delicatissima (5 localities), 47 I. iguana (12 localities) and 27 hybrids (5 localities), who were all identified based on morphological characters, have been genotyped at 15 microsatellites markers. We also sequenced hybrids using ND4 mitochondrial loci to further investigate mitochondrial introgression. The genetic clustering of species and hybrid genetic assignment were performed using a comparative approach, through the implementation of a Discriminant Analysis of Principal Component (DAPC) based on statistics, as well as genetic clustering approaches based on the genetic models of several populations (Structure, NewHybrids and HIest), in order to get full characterization of hybridization patterns and introgression dynamics across the islands. The iguanas identified as hybrids in the wild, thanks to morphological analysis, were all genetically F1, F2, or backcrosses. A high proportion of individuals were also the result of a longer-term admixture. The absence of reproductive barriers between species leads to hybridization when species are in contact. Yet morphological and behavioral differences between species could explain why males I. iguana may dominate I. delicatissima, thus resulting in short-term species displacement and extinction by hybridization and recurrent introgression from I. iguana toward I. delicatissima. As a consequence, I. delicatissima gets eliminated through introgression, as observed in recent population history over several islands. These results have profound implications for species management of the endangered I. delicatissima and practical conservation recommendations are being discussed in the light of these findings.},
