	abstract = {A nucleotide sequence analysis of a portion of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit was performed to define the phylogeography of the threatened crayfish Austropotamobius (Decapoda; Astacidae) in Italy. We collected 61 specimens from 31 localities across the Italian peninsula. For the phylogenetic inference, we combined the 61 Austropotamobius spp sequences obtained from this study with 18 sequences deposited in GenBank and corresponding to Italian, French, Irish, Swiss, and Slovenian locations. Among the analysed sequences, 34 distinct haplotypes were detected. Our results confirmed the presence of both A. pallipes and A. italicus in the Italian peninsula and the existence within the latter species of a strong intraspecific genetic variation, due to the occurrence of four subspecies with a well-defined geographic distribution. From a conservation viewpoint, Italy, with its high haplotype variability, may be considered a ‘hot spot’ for the genetic diversity of the European native crayfish Austropotamobius. We suggest that re-introduction programs should be conducted with extreme caution in Italy, since not only the two Austropotamobius species but also the four A. italicus subspecies are genetically and taxonomically separate units and require independent conservation plans.},

	abstract = {The infraorder Anomura consists of a morphologically and ecologically heterogeneous group of decapod crustaceans, and has attracted interest from taxonomists for decades attempting to find some order out of the seemingly chaotic diversity within the group. Species-level diversity within the Anomura runs the gamut from the “hairy” spindly-legged yeti crab found in deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments to the largest known terrestrial invertebrate, the robust coconut or robber crab. Owing to a well-developed capacity for parallel evolution, as evidenced by the occurrence of multiple independent carcinization events, Anomura has long tested the patience and skill of both taxonomists attempting to find order, and phylogeneticists trying to establish stable hypotheses of evolutionary inter-relationships. In this study, we performed genome skimming to recover the mitogenome sequences of 12 anomuran species including the world’s largest extant invertebrate, the robber crab (Birgus latro), thereby over doubling these resources for this group, together with 8 new brachyuran mitogenomes. Maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian-inferred (BI) phylogenetic reconstructions based on amino acid sequences from mitogenome protein-coding genes provided strong support for the monophyly of the Anomura and Brachyura and their sister relationship, consistent with previous studies. The majority of relationships within families were supported and were largely consistent with current taxonomic classifications, whereas many relationships at higher taxonomic levels were unresolved. Nevertheless, we have strong support for a polyphyletic Paguroidea and recovered a well-supported clade of a subset of paguroids (Diogenidae + Coenobitidae) basal to all other anomurans, though this requires further testing with greater taxonomic sampling. We also introduce a new feature to the MitoPhAST bioinformatics pipeline (https://github.com/mht85/MitoPhAST) that enables the extraction of mitochondrial gene order (MGO) information directly from GenBank files and clusters groups based on common MGOs. Using this tool, we compared MGOs across the Anomura and Brachyura, identifying Anomura as a taxonomic “hot spot” with high variability in MGOs among congeneric species from multiple families while noting the broad association of highly-rearranged MGOs with several anomuran lineages inhabiting extreme niches. We also demonstrate the value of MGOs as a source of novel synapomorphies for independently reinforcing tree-based relationships and for shedding light on relationships among challenging groups such as the Aegloidea and Lomisoidea that were unresolved in phylogenetic reconstructions. Overall, this study contributes a substantial amount of new genetic material for Anomura and attempts to further resolve anomuran evolutionary relationships where possible based on a combination of sequence and MGO information. The new feature in MitoPhAST adds to the relatively limited number of bioinformatics tools available for MGO analyses, which can be utilized widely across animal groups.},

	abstract = {With the advent of the Anthropocene, biological invasions have reached an unprecedented level, and the number of species introductions is still increasing in an ever-changing world. Despite major advances in invasion science, significant debate and lack of clarity remain surrounding the determinants of success of introduced species, the magnitude and dimensions of their impact, and the mechanisms sustaining successful invasions. Empirical studies show divergent impacts of alien populations on ecosystems and contrasting effects of biotic and abiotic factors on the dynamics of alien populations, which hinders the creation of a unified theory of biological invasions. Compounding these issues is the plethora of hypotheses that aim to explain invasion success, which can be unclear and contradictory. We propose a synthesis that categorizes hypotheses along a timeline of invasion. We sorted invasion hypotheses along the invasion timeline, and considered population, community and ecosystem levels. This temporal sorting of invasion concepts shows that each is relevant at a specific stage of the invasion. Although concepts and empirical findings on alien species may appear contradictory, when mapped onto an invasion timeline, they may be combined in a complementary way. An overall scheme is proposed to summarise the theoretical dynamics of ecosystems subjected to invasions. For any given case study, this framework provides a guide through the maze of theories and should help choose the appropriate concepts according to the stage of invasion.},

Old experimental work that reported transmission of crayfish plague to the Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis, and the ability of A. astaci to grow in non-decapod crustaceans, has never been tested properly. We re-evaluated the host range of A. astaci by screening for the presence of A. astaci in two crab species cohabiting with infected crayfish in fresh waters, as well as in other higher crustaceans from such localities. The animals were tested with species-specific quantitative PCR, and the pathogen determination was confirmed by sequencing of an amplified fragment of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer. Furthermore, we examined microscopically cuticle samples from presumably infected crab individuals for the presence of A. astaci-like hyphae and checked for the presence of pathogen DNA in such samples. Screenings of benthopelagic mysids, amphipods and benthic isopods did not suggest infection by A. astaci in non-decapod crustaceans. In contrast, both studied lake populations of crabs (a native semiterrestrial species Potamon potamios in Turkey, and an invasive catadromous E. sinensis in Sweden) were infected with this parasite according to both molecular and microscopic evidence. Analyses of polymorphic microsatellite loci demonstrated that A. astaci strains in the crabs and in cohabiting crayfish belonged to the same genotype group, suggesting crayfish as the source for crab infection. The potential for A. astaci transmission in the opposite direction, from crabs to crayfish, and potential impact of this pathogen on populations of freshwater crabs require further investigations, because of possible consequences for crayfish and freshwater crab conservation and aquaculture.},

This phenomenon could result in the extinction of endemic species. This study aims at investigating the hybridization dynamics between the endemic and threatened Lesser Antillean iguana (Iguana delicatissima) and the invasive common green iguana (Iguana iguana) in the Lesser Antilles, as well as assessing the impact of interspecific hybridization on the decline of I. delicatissima. 59 I. delicatissima (5 localities), 47 I. iguana (12 localities) and 27 hybrids (5 localities), who were all identified based on morphological characters, have been genotyped at 15 microsatellites markers. We also sequenced hybrids using ND4 mitochondrial loci to further investigate mitochondrial introgression. The genetic clustering of species and hybrid genetic assignment were performed using a comparative approach, through the implementation of a Discriminant Analysis of Principal Component (DAPC) based on statistics, as well as genetic clustering approaches based on the genetic models of several populations (Structure, NewHybrids and HIest), in order to get full characterization of hybridization patterns and introgression dynamics across the islands. The iguanas identified as hybrids in the wild, thanks to morphological analysis, were all genetically F1, F2, or backcrosses. A high proportion of individuals were also the result of a longer-term admixture. The absence of reproductive barriers between species leads to hybridization when species are in contact. Yet morphological and behavioral differences between species could explain why males I. iguana may dominate I. delicatissima, thus resulting in short-term species displacement and extinction by hybridization and recurrent introgression from I. iguana toward I. delicatissima. As a consequence, I. delicatissima gets eliminated through introgression, as observed in recent population history over several islands. These results have profound implications for species management of the endangered I. delicatissima and practical conservation recommendations are being discussed in the light of these findings.},

	abstract = {Aphanomyces astaci, the crayfish plague pathogen, first appeared in Europe in the mid-19th century and is still responsible for mass mortalities of native European crayfish. The spread of this parasite across the continent is especially facilitated by invasive North American crayfish species that serve as its reservoir. In France, multiple cases of native crayfish mortalities have been suggested to be connected with the presence of the signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus, which is highly abundant in the country. It shares similar habitats as the native white-clawed crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes and, when infected, the signal crayfish might therefore easily transmit the pathogen to the native species. We investigated the prevalence of A. astaci in French signal crayfish populations to evaluate the danger they represent to local populations of native crayfish. Over 500 individuals of Pacifastacus leniusculus from 45 French populations were analysed, plus several additional individuals of other non-indigenous crayfish species Orconectes limosus, O. immunis and Procambarus clarkii. Altogether, 20 % of analysed signal crayfish tested positive for Aphanomyces astaci, and the pathogen was detected in more than half of the studied populations. Local prevalence varied significantly, ranging from 0 % up to 80 %, but wide confidence intervals suggest that the number of populations infected by A. astaci may be even higher than our results show. Analysis of several individuals of other introduced species revealed infections among two of these, O. immunis and P. clarkii. Our results confirm that the widespread signal crayfish serves as a key reservoir of Aphanomyces astaci in France and therefore represents a serious danger to native crayfish species, especially the white-clawed crayfish. The prevalence in other non-indigenous crayfish should also be investigated as they likely contribute to pathogen transmission in the country.},

The clades A (including A1, A2, A3) and B are separated by a high genetic divergence (5 %).

The average of genetic divergence within the major group A and B was 2.1 % ± 1.2 and 0.9 % ± 0.6 respectively. Three clades A1, A2 and A3 correspond mainly to crayfish sampled from Austria-Switzerland, South of Balkans and Italy-Spain respectively.

	abstract = {Aphanomyces astaci is an invasive pathogenic oomycete responsible for the crayfish plague, a disease that has devastated European freshwater crayfish. So far, five genotype groups of this pathogen have been identified by applying random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis on axenic cultures. To allow genotyping of A. astaci in host tissue samples, we have developed co-dominant microsatellite markers for this pathogen, tested them on pure cultures of all genotype groups, and subsequently evaluated their use on tissues of (1) natural A. astaci carriers, i.e., North American crayfish species, and (2) A. astaci-infected indigenous European species from crayfish plague outbreaks. Out of over 200 potential loci containing simple sequence repeat (SSR) motifs identified by 454 pyrosequencing of SSR-enriched library, we tested 25 loci with highest number of repeats, and finally selected nine that allow unambiguous separation of all known RAPD-defined genotype groups of A. astaci from axenic cultures. Using these markers, we were able to characterize A. astaci strains from DNA isolates from infected crayfish tissues when crayfish had a moderate to high agent level according to quantitative PCR analyses. The results support the hypothesis that different North American crayfish hosts carry different genotype groups of the pathogen, and confirm that multiple genotype groups, including the one originally introduced to Europe in the 19th century, cause crayfish plague outbreaks in Central Europe. So far undocumented A. astaci genotype seems to have caused one of the analysed outbreaks from the Czech Republic. The newly developed culture-independent approach allowing direct genotyping of this pathogen in both axenic cultures and mixed genome samples opens new possibilities in studies of crayfish plague pathogen distribution, diversity and epidemiology.},

Four decamer primers which generated six unambiguous polymorphic bands were used to analyse crayfish from 21 populations sampled in the major part of its range. Genetic diversity within populations of A. pallipes, estimated by Shannon’s diversity index, ranged from 0 to 0.446 with a mean of 0.159. A UPGMA dendrogram constructed from pairwise ΦST values between populations, revealed three clusters corresponding to populations sampled in the southern, northwestern and eastern part of its range. AMOVA analysis revealed a high genetic structure of A. pallipes populations ΦST=0.814, with 73.11 % of the genetic variation distributed between these clusters. It suggests a historical geographical separation of these groups into three refugial areas, probably in the Rhine, Mediterranean and Atlantic basins during recent glaciations. The close genetic relationships between English and western French populations are in accordance with a natural postglacial origin of English populations from individuals having survived in an Atlantic refugium. However, the present results suggest that the Irish stock originated from a human translocation of individuals from an Atlantic refugium.},

The threatened status of this species shows the necessity to establish a suitable management to protect it. An efficient management requires an increase in our knowledge about existing populations. By using allometric relationships, we characterized the size at the onset of sexual maturity in both sexes and evaluated sexual dimorphism in this population. The size at the onset of sexual maturity appeared to be different in both sexes (20.1 mm POL in males and 18.17 mm POL in females). The sexual dimorphism, shown by the variables of claw length and abdominal width, was not closely related to the puberal moult. The growth rates of this population were very different from those shown by other European populations. Discriminant analysis was performed on the data, but it did not separate the juveniles of both sexes. This study provides fundamental results concerning the relative growth of A. pallipes which could be used to compare several French populations in the future. /// Ce travail porte sur le dimorphisme sexuel et sur la croissance allométrique d'une population française de l'écrevisse autochtone, Austropotamobius pallipes pallipes.

Le dimorphisme sexuel, montré par les variables largeur de la pince et largeur de l'abdomen, n'est pas étroitement lié à la mue de puberté. Les taux de croissance sont très différents de ceux trouvés pour d'autres populations européennes. L'analyse discriminante appliquée sur les même données n'a pas permis de séparer les juvéniles des deux sexes. Cette étude fournit des résultats fondamentaux sur la croissance relative d'A. pallipes; ils pourront être utilisés pour comparer plusieurs populations françaises.},

	abstract = {1. The white-clawed crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes has a widespread distribution in Europe, but since the last century its distribution has been severely affected by a combination of factors, particularly the disease crayfish plague, introduced by foreign crayfish species. At present A. pallipes is considered as vulnerable and endangered and measures are being taken in a number of countries to conserve it. 2. The application of genetics to conservation is of practical value particularly where restocking is being considered. This study assesses levels of genetic differentiation from an analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation by restriction fragment length polymorphism of four populations sampled on a European scale. Six different composite haplotypes were detected among sixty-four crayfish representing the four populations. mtDNA nucleon diversity values within species ranged from 0.63 % to 12.35 %. A close genetic similarity was found between British and French populations of A. pallipes. 3. Results show that mtDNA can be as a suitable diagnostic marker for measuring genetic diversity between crayfish populations and that such information is of use in planning crayfish conservation strategies.},

	abstract = {Pioneering investigations on the effects of introduced populations on community structure, ecosystem functioning and services have focused on the effects of invaders on taxonomic diversity. However, taxonomic-based diversity metrics overlook the heterogeneity of species roles within and among communities. As the homogenizing effects of biological invasions on community and ecosystem processes can be subtle, they may require the use of functional diversity indices to be properly evidenced. Starting from the listing of major functional diversity indices, alongside the presentation of their strengths and limitations, we focus on studies pertaining to the effects of invasive species on native communities and recipient ecosystems using functional diversity indices. By doing so, we reveal that functional diversity of the recipient community may strongly vary at the onset of the invasion process, while it stabilizes at intermediate and high levels of invasion. As functional changes occurring during the lag phase of an invasion have been poorly investigated, we show that it is still unknown whether there are consistent changes in functional diversity metrics that could indicate the end of the lag phase. Thus, we recommend providing information on the invasion stage under consideration when computing functional diversity metrics. For the existing literature, it is also surprising that very few studies explored the functional difference between organisms from the recipient communities and invaders of the same trophic levels, or assessed the effects of non-native organism establishment into a non-analogue versus an analogue community. By providing valuable tools for obtaining in-depth diagnostics of community structure and functioning, functional diversity indices can be applied for timely implementation of restoration plans and improved conservation strategies. To conclude, our work provides a first synthetic guide for their use in hypothesis testing in invasion biology.},

Two hypotheses have been formulated about the origin of the crayfish: from British populations or from western French populations. In order to resolve this question, nine Irish crayfish populations (a total of 124 individuals) were sampled along a south–north cline and investigated by combining two molecular markers: mtDNA and RAPDs. The mtDNA marker, analysed by RFLP on the entire molecule, showed an absence of polymorphism within and among Irish populations. The RFLP haplotype found in Irish populations was only recorded in western French populations and was different from those found in English populations. This result may be explained by a human introduction of crayfish to Ireland from western French populations. RAPD analysis showed a clinal reduction of genetic variability within Irish populations from south to north, associated with an increase in their genetic differentiation. A stepwise model of translocation from the south to the north of Ireland is proposed and discussed.},

Wolbachia induce feminization in many terrestrial isopod species, particularly in the genus Armadillidium (Crustacea, Oniscidea). The diversity of Wolbachia strains infecting Armadillidium species was examined. Results reveal that natural populations of A. vulgare contain three different Wolbachia strains (wVulC, wVulM and wVulP). The wsp gene and its 3′-adjacent region show evidence that two recombination events have occurred between two of these strains. In both cases, multiple statistical analyses suggest that a small gene fragment of a strain closely related to wVulM (minor parent) is inserted into the genome of another strain closely related to wVulC (major parent). Although multiple infections in a single individual have never been demonstrated in natural population, the existence of recombination between feminizing strains suggests that bi-infections are possible, or at least that bi-infections can be maintained sufficiently long enough to allow recombination. Recombination events increase genetic diversity of Wolbachia found in Armadillidium species and may play a role in the ability of Wolbachia strains to invade new hosts.},

Interpopulational genetic relationships showed that Spanish populations were closely related to those of Fosso di Ferfereta with a small genetic distance (0.0003) found between them.

	abstract = {1. In France, the distribution of the native white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes) is restricted, fragmented and mainly located in headwater streams. To conserve this indigenous species, it is necessary to characterize its habitat preferences. 2. Seven brooks in the Deux-Sèvres Département (western France) containing wild populations of A. pallipes were studied to determine its ranges of tolerance to 19 physical and chemical water parameters. On two brooks, the Sèvre Nantaise and the Verdonnière, sites with and without A. pallipes were compared. Each site was sampled twice monthly from November 2002 to November 2004. 3. It was found that the white-clawed crayfish was able to tolerate wide ranges of values of some of the measured parameters. The Magot site harboured the largest A. pallipes population (17.5 crayfish m−2) and had dissolved oxygen concentrations as low as 4.93 mg L−1, while water temperature rose above 20°C for several consecutive days during summer and nitrate concentrations were always found to be above 30 mg L−1. These unusual findings could call into question the status of A. pallipes as a bioindicator of good water quality. 4. Principal component analyses (PCA) suggested that an increase of organic matter was a discriminant factor for the presence or absence of A. pallipes. In addition, sites with and without crayfish on the Sèvre Nantaise brook showed showed significant differences (p{ textless}0.05) in total organic carbon (TOC), and those on the Verdonnière brook in turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS).

During a controlled infection experiment with a susceptible crayfish species Astacus astacus using three A. astaci strains (representing genotype groups A, B, and E), we investigated variation in their virulence and in crayfish immune defence indicators (haemocyte density, phenoloxidase activity, and production of reactive oxygen species). Experimental crayfish were exposed to two dosages of A. astaci spores (1 and 10sporesmL−1). The intensity and timing of the immune response differed between the strains as well as between the spore concentrations. Stronger and faster change in each immune parameter was observed in crayfish infected with two more virulent strains, indicating a relationship between crayfish immune response and A. astaci virulence. Similarly, the immune response was stronger and was observed earlier for the higher spore concentration. For the first time, the virulence of a strain of the genotype group E (isolated from Orconectes limosus) was experimentally tested. Total mortality was reached after 10days for the two higher spore dosages (10 and 100sporesmL−1), and after 16days for the lowest (1sporemL−1), revealing equally high and rapid mortality as caused by the genotype group B (from Pacifastacus leniusculus).

	abstract = {The North American spiny-cheek crayfish, Orconectes limosus (Rafinesque, 1817), a widespread invader in Europe, seems to have been introduced there successfully only once. According to available literature, 90 individuals of unclear origin were released in Poland in 1890. Despite this apparent bottleneck, the species has successfully colonized various aquatic habitats and has displaced native crayfish species in many places. To test whether different European populations were likely to have come from a single source and to identify their possible origin, we analyzed the diversity of the mitochondrial gene for cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) of O. limosus individuals from Europe and from its original range in North America, including the presumed source region of European populations, the Delaware River watershed (eastern USA). Two haplotypes were found in European populations. One haplotype was widespread; the other was present in a single population. In contrast, 18 haplotypes were detected in North America. This result supports the hypothesis of a single overseas introduction of O. limosus and suggests that the high invasion success of this species was not limited by an introduction bottleneck. Two divergent clades were detected in North American O. limosus populations. One, which includes the dominant haplotype in Europe, was found in a large part of the species’ present range. The 2nd (diverging by { textgreater}1 %) was mostly restricted to a limited area in southeastern Pennsylvania. Orconectes limosus populations in the northern part of the species’ North American range, at least some of which are nonindigenous themselves, may share the source area with European O. limosus. The endangered status of O. limosus populations in southeastern Pennsylvania and northeastern Maryland, where much of the species’ genetic diversity resides, should be considered in conservation management.},

Here, we assess population differentiation in the freshwater crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, an endangered species endemic to western Europe and provide valuable information for the conservation of French populations. 2. Analysis of five microsatellite loci in 44 populations revealed very different within population levels of genetic diversity (0.000 { textless} H0 { textless} 0.564). Two groups, corresponding to northern and southern French populations, showed a high degree of genetic differentiation in both allele frequencies and allele sizes. Comparison of these results with previous studies of A. pallipes strongly suggests that the divergence between northern and southern populations could have occurred during the last glaciation period of the Pleistocene from one Atlantic and one Mediterranean refuge. 3. Evidence for genetic admixture between these two lineages was revealed by correspondence analyses in southern populations, probably as the result of artificial translocations. 4. French populations appeared significantly differentiated among the different river drainages and were highly structured within rivers. The impact of population size, population bottlenecks and founder events on the population genetic differentiation are discussed. 5. Based on these results, we propose the designation of two evolutionarily significant units for A. pallipes in France. Our data also support the maintenance of separate demographic management strategies for crayfish inhabiting different river systems. However, genetic analyses will have to be combined with demographic and ecological data for sustainable conservation programmes.},

Using species delimitation methods on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences, we propose four primary species hypotheses for WCC. Sequences for several nuclear regions were screened but none showed significant variation within WCC. This result favours a single secondary species hypothesis and indicates the existence of a mito-nuclear discordance in WCC. Therefore, mtDNA groups were considered only as genetic units that carry information about ancient divergences within WCC and not as taxonomic units. The reconstruction of ancestral ranges and divergence time estimates were used to link the current genetic structure with paleogeographic processes. These results showed that the emergence of mtDNA groups in WCC could be related to the Messinian Salinity Crisis, the climate cooling during the Pliocene and Pleistocene, and (paleo)shifting of the Adriatic Sea coastline in the Padanovenezian Plain. The most recent common ancestor of the mtDNA groups most likely originated from Dalmatia (eastern Adriatic coast) as indicated by the reconstruction of ancestral ranges. This ecoregion, along with the Gulf of Venice Drainages, harbours a high genetic diversity and should be emphasised as an area of the highest conservation priority.},

To address some outstanding issues in the relationships among Northern Hemisphere freshwater crayfish (Astacoidea), we sequenced the partial genome of crayfish species from Asian, North American and European genera and report the successful recovery of whole mitogenome sequences in addition to three highly repetitive nuclear genes, namely histone H3, 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA. Consistent with some previous studies using short mtDNA and nuclear gene fragments, phylogenetic analyses based on the concatenation of recovered mitochondrial and/or nuclear sequences recovered the Asian cambarid lineage as basal to all astacids and North American cambarids, which conflicts with the current taxonomic classification based on morphological and reproduction-related characters. Lastly, we show that complete H3, 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA genes can also be consistently recovered from a diverse range of animal taxa, demonstrating the potential wide utility of genome skimming for nuclear markers.},

We assessed the position of both known European populations within the species complex by sequencing part of the mitochondrial gene for cytochrome c oxidase subunit I. Tested UK and Dutch individuals did not belong to any mitochondrial lineage recorded in North America so far but formed a separate clade, the original distribution area of which is unknown. Additionally sequenced virile crayfish from Iowa (USA) also represented a new clade, suggesting that undiscovered lineage variation within O. virilis remains high.

To preserve this indigenous species, it is necessary to characterize its ecological requirements (water and habitat quality). With this aim in view, a two-year study is being conducted in the Deux-Sèvres department (Western France) since November 2002. Nine brooks from four different catchments are monitored regularly; eight of the nine brooks harbour whiteclawed crayfish populations. Two sampling sites are surveyed per brook, the first being where the crayfish population is located and the second 2 to 3 km downstream. Physicochemical parameters (18) are measured twice monthly and biotic factors are estimated twice yearly. In this study, the I.B.G.N. (Indice Biologique Global Normalisé) protocol based on the determination of macroinvertebrates was used as a biotic index of biological water quality. Results of this preliminary study on two brooks (Thouet and Verdonnière) show that physico-chemical and biological data considered separately do not provide reliable information about A. pallipes ecological requirements. However, the use of multivariate analyses (Principal Component Analysis) to combine abiotic and biotic factors highlights a good correlation between these parameters. Organic matter appears to be a better discriminating factor than mineral matter affecting presence or absence of the whiteclawed crayfish.},

	abstract = {The lesser Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean is known as a biodiversity hotspot, hosting many endemic species. However, recent introduction of a highly invasive species, the Australian redclaw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus), has led to significant threats to this fragile ecosystem. Here we developed, validated, and optimized a species-specific eDNA-based detection protocol targeting the 16S region of the mitochondrial gene of C. quadricarinatus. Our aim was to assess the crayfish distribution across Martinique Island. Our developed assay was species-specific and showed high sensitivity in laboratory, mesocosm and field conditions. A significant and positive correlation was found between species biomass, detection probability and efficiency through mesocosm experiments. Moreover, we found eDNA persisted up to 23 days in tropical freshwaters. We investigated a total of 83 locations, spread over 53 rivers and two closed water basins using our novel eDNA assay and traditional trapping, the latter, undertaken to confirm the reliability of the molecular-based detection method. Overall, we detected C. quadricarinatus at 47 locations using eDNA and 28 using traditional trapping, all positive trapping sites were positive for eDNA. We found that eDNA-based monitoring was less time-consuming and less influenced by the crayfishes often patchy distributions, proving a more reliable tool for future large-scale surveys. The clear threat and worrying distribution of this invasive species is particularly alarming as the archipelago belongs to one of the 25 identified biodiversity hotspots on Earth.},

They have limited dispersal abilities and rely on the connectivity between habitats and their suitability. In a warming climate, the locations of suitable habitats are expected to change, as is the connectivity. Here, we wondered how climate change might affect shifts in habitat suitability and connectivity of habitat patches, as connectivity is a key element enabling species to realize a potential range shift. We used ecological niche modelling (ENM), combining large-scale climate suitability with local scale, high-resolution habitat features, to identify suitable areas for the two species, under low and high warming scenarios (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5). We associated it with connectivity assessment through graph theory. The variable ‘small ponds’ contributed most to land cover-only ENMs for both species. Projections with climate change scenarios revealed a potential impact of warming on suitable habitat patches for newts, especially for T. cristatus. We observed a decrease in connectivity following a decrease in patch suitability. Our results highlight the important areas for newt habitat connectivity within the study area, and define those potentially threatened by climate warming. We provide information for prioritizing sites for acquisition, protection or restoration, and to advise landscape policies. Our framework is a useful and easily reproducible way to combine global climate requirements of the species with detailed information on species habitats and occurrence when available.},

However, a few exceptions do exist and among them two terrestrial isopods Armadillidium vulgare and Porcellionides pruinosus have an atypical mtDNA composed of linear monomers associated with circular “head-to-head” dimers: a very unusual structure for animal mtDNA genome. To assess the distribution of this atypical mtDNA among isopods, we performed RFLP and Southern blot analyses on mtDNA of 16 terrestrial (Oniscidea family) and two aquatic isopod species: the marine Sphaeroma serratum (suborder Flabellifera, sister group of Oniscidea) and the freshwater Asellus aquaticus (Asellota, early derived taxon of isopod). The atypical mtDNA structure was observed in 15 terrestrial isopod species and A. aquaticus, suggesting a wide distribution of atypical mtDNA among isopods. However, a typical metazoan mtDNA structure was detected in the marine isopod S. serratum and the Oniscidea Ligia oceanica. Our results suggest two possible scenarios: an early origin of the atypical mtDNA in isopods followed by reversion to the typical ancestral mtDNA structure for several species, or a convergent appearance of the atypical mtDNA structure in two isopod suborders. We compare this distribution of the atypical mtDNA structure with the presence of a heteroplasmy also observed in the mtDNA of several terrestrial isopod species. We discuss if this transmitted heteroplasmy is vectored by the atypical mtDNA and its impact on the maintenance of the atypical mtDNA in isopods.},

MtDNA analysis by RFLP using 6 endonucleases revealed 5 haplotypes and allowed unequivocal identification of the subspecies. The nucleotide sequence divergence among haplotypes characteristic of each subspecies ranged from 10.93-13.6 % and may be explained by an ancient geographical separation of each subspecies. This distribution of genetic variation agrees with the presumption of 3 refugial regions during the glaciation periods, possibly the Iberian Peninsula, southern France, and the Balkans.

	abstract = {1. A study on the genetic variability of the white-clawed crayfish was carried out based on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene sequences. The sequences applied were more informative regarding white-clawed crayfish genetic variability than others previously used. 2. Two haplotypes were found to exist in the Iberian Peninsula. The haplotypes exhibit a strong geographic subdivision (ΦST=0.83). One of the Iberian haplotypes was similar to north Italian haplotypes and the second differed in only one mutation. This pattern of genetic variability contrasts with those found in glacial refugial areas of France, Italy and the Balkan Peninsula. 3. Two hypotheses on the origin of the white-clawed crayfish in the Iberian Peninsula are discussed: (i) one based on an anthropogenic origin, and (ii) a second based on a successive number of postglacial ancient and recent bottlenecks, i.e. the disjunction between Iberian and Italian populations of white-clawed crayfish species is due to competition between A. italicus and A. pallipes, in addition to the impact of crayfish plague and human translocations. 4. New references for the white-clawed crayfish in the Iberian Peninsula were found in medieval and Arabic texts. The results show that this species has been thriving in this peninsula since ancient periods and that its indigenous status should not be questioned. 5. Conservation action and plans should consider the low genetic diversity as a limitation for farm-raising specimens more adapted and resistant to changing environments and diseases.

	abstract = {The white-clawed crayfish, { textless}i{ textgreater}Austropotamobius pallipes pallipes{ textless}i/{ textgreater}, still has a wide-spread distribution in France, but since the last century, populations have declined because of habitat alteration (due to human disturbance) and have been also eliminated by crayfish plague, for which introduced exotic species are a vector. Action plans for the conservation of { textless}i{ textgreater}A. pallipes{ textless}i/{ textgreater} are urgent and if recovery programmes are to be initiated in France, then it is important to estimate how much genetic variation is partitioned between remaining populations as the species is being currently threatened in all its European distribution. We show how a new molecular marker can be used to study crayfish populations. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation in natural populations was examined by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in samples taken from fifteen French populations and six European populations representative of three subspecies observed in { textless}i{ textgreater}A. pallipes{ textless}i/{ textgreater} in order to examine the extent of differentiation between populations. Biogeographic considerations about the genetic distances observed between the three subspecies are made. The study reveals a low level of genetic variation among English, Welsh and most of French populations, corresponding to a genetic stock uniformity among { textless}i{ textgreater}A. pallipes pallipes{ textless}i/{ textgreater} . The only two French populations exhibiting a high level of intrapopulational genetic variation are in fact mixed samples : the comparison with results obtained in European populations revealed that the first population was composed of the two subspecies { textless}i{ textgreater}A. pallipes pallipes{ textless}i/{ textgreater} and { textless}i{ textgreater}A. pallipes italicus{ textless}i/{ textgreater} and the second of { textless}i{ textgreater}A. pallipes italicus{ textless}i/{ textgreater} and { textless}i{ textgreater}A. pallipes lusitanicus{ textless}i/{ textgreater}. Results proved that some repopulations, performed in the past from { textless}i{ textgreater}A. pallipes italicus{ textless}i/{ textgreater} and supposed having failed, have been successful and that the French stock did not correspond to the only subspecies { textless}i{ textgreater}A. pallipes pallipes{ textless}i/{ textgreater}. A first analysis of genetic variance observed on a regional scale revealed that there was no genetic structure according to basins and could reflect human-mediated movement of crayfish stocks between these basins. Consequently, mtDNA is an essential marker to measure genetic diversity between crayfish populations, to map how the subspecies are partitioned in France and what the importance of each is before any planning crayfish conservation strategies of the native crayfish},

	abstract = {1. IntroductionThe Decapoda represent a highly speciose and diverse group of crustaceans that provide important ecosystem services across mainly marine and freshwater environments, with many of the larger species being of significant commercial importance for fisheries and aquaculture industries. The value of generating and using genomic resources for key crustacean species and groups is widely appreciated for a variety of purposes including phylogenetic and population studies, selective breeding programs and broodstock management (Tan et al., 2016; Grandjean et al., 2017; Wolfe et al., 2019; Zenger et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). However, comprehensive genomic studies are particularly limited for decapod crustaceans (Zenger et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019), compared to other aquatic invertebrate groups. Most genomic-related studies on decapod crustaceans have focused on mitogenome recovery and transcriptomics studies, with few genome assemblies attempted and most of these on commercially-important species (Song et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019). Of the decapod species for which genome assemblies have been published and are publicly available, the quality is highly variable and BUSCO completeness poor with the exception of Procambarus virginalis (87.0 %) and Litopeneaus vannamei (84.6 %) (Table 1). It is now apparent that the assembly and annotation of decapod genomes are highly challenging due to the need to deal with large repetitive genomes, often with high heterozygosity, and should not to be undertaken by the faint-hearted or on a shoe-string budget (Zhang et al., 2019).The lack of genomic resources coupled with limited understanding of the molecular basis of gene expression and phenotypic variation will continue to limit advances in aquaculture-based productivity of decapods. Understanding the molecular basis of phenotypic variation and gene function is therefore important for selective breeding programs for traits such as increased growth and disease resistance (Zenger et al., 2019). Similarly, whole genome assemblies support genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify trait-specific loci and for genomic-based selective breeding.Freshwater crayfishes make up an important group of Decapod crustaceans (Crandall and De Grave, 2017) naturally occurring on all continents, with the exception of Antarctica and Africa (Toon et al., 2010; Bracken-Grissom et al., 2014). They reach their greatest species richness in Australia and north America. A number of species are subject to aquaculture and recreational, and indigenous and bait fisheries, and others are of conservation concern due to a range of activities threatening vulnerable freshwater environments (Piper, 2000; Richman et al., 2015; CABI, 2019). The genomic architecture and karyotype evolution of freshwater crayfish is also of interest as they have some of the largest chromosome numbers (2n=200) recorded for invertebrate species (Tan et al., 2004). In Australia, freshwater crayfish species from the genus Cherax Erichson, known as smooth yabbies, include the largest commercial crayfish species in the world (Austin, 1987; 1996; Austin and Knott, 1996). Of these, the economically-important and best known is the red claw crayfish, Cherax quadricarinatus von Martens, distributed widely across northern Australia (Austin, 1996; FAO, 2019). The species is capable of growing to greater than 200 grams making it the second largest commercial species of Cherax (Austin, 1987) behind the marron (C. cainii Austin) (Austin and Ryan, 2002). The popularity of the red claw as an aquaculture and ornamental species and its adaptability has resulted in widespread translocation, resulting in an extensive global distribution and it is acknowledged as a major invasive species of inland aquatic ecosystems in the tropics (Ahyong and Yeo, 2007; Larson and Olden, 2013; Saoud et al., 2013). Due to its large size and ease with which it can be maintained in captivity, C. quadricarinatus is also increasingly being used as a model organism to address fundamental questions relevant to molecular biology, physiology, functional genomics and cell biology (Fern & #225;ndez et al., 2012; Pamuru et al., 2012; Ventura et al., 2019).The genetics of C. quadricarinatus has been well studied using PCR-based approaches and recently, next generation sequencing has been used for mitogenomic and transcriptomic studies (Baker et al., 2008; Gan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2016). In this paper, we present the first genome assembly for a southern hemisphere crayfish using a hybrid assembly approach utilising long Nanopore reads and short Illumina reads, which has proven to be an efficient and effective approach for the assembly and annotation of species with large and repetitive genomes (Austin et al., 2017; Tan et al., 2018; Gan et al., 2019; S & #225;nchez-Herrero et al., 2019), but has only been minimally explored to support decapod assemblies (Van Quyen et al., 2020).We then benchmark our assembly against seven other published decapod genome assemblies and present a preliminary phylogenomic analysis for decapod crustaceans. Lastly, we use these data to investigate the occurrence and diversification of nuclear mitochondrial DNA (NUMTs) in decapod genomes, which is directly relevant to debates on the veracity of the most common approach to the DNA barcoding of life for molecular-based taxonomic identification and biodiversity assessment based on the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (cox1) gene region (Hebert et al., 2003; Cristescu, 2014; deWaard et al., 2018).2. Materials and Methods2.1 Data generationTissue samples from two male C. quadricarinatus individuals were collected from Northern Territory in Australia, DWN1 from Rapid Creek and M2R2 from Charles Darwin University Aquaculture Centre, both located in Darwin following institutionally endorsed ethical, biosecurity and safety guidelines. Genomic DNA was extracted using E.Z.N.A. & #174; Tissue DNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek) from tail muscle tissue. One microgram of DWN1 was sent to Macrogen, Korea for PCR-free library preparation and sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Additional Illumina sequencing on the Novaseq6000 was also performed at Deakin Genomics Centre using a PCR-based library constructed with NEBNext Ultra Illumina library preparation kit. Using tissue samples from DWN1 and M2R2 individuals, for each Nanopore library, approximately 1 ug of gDNA as measured by Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen) was processed using the LSK108 library preparation kit followed by sequencing on the R9.4 MinION flowcell. Nanopore data was basecalled with Albacore versions compatible with kits and flowcells used (discontinued, was available on https://community.nanoporetech.com) and adapter-trimmed with the Porechop tool (Wick, 2017).2.2 De novo assembly and scaffolding of the crayfish genomeRaw reads were pre-processed prior to assembly. The fastp tool (--poly _g _min _len 1) (Chen et al., 2018) was used to trim polyG sequences from the 3’ end of reads generated on the Illumina NovaSeq platform. All short reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014) to eliminate adapters (ILLUMINACLIP:2:30:10) and low quality sequences (AVGQUAL:20), and subsequently assembled with the Platanus assembler (Kajitani et al., 2014) using default parameters. The repeat content and large size of this genome necessitated scaffolding of the assembly with several data types; these included the use of short and long reads in order to span gaps of various sizes, in addition to using data from a previous C. quadricarinatus transcriptome project (Tan et al., 2016) to stitch together scaffolds containing coding genes. A first level of scaffolding was performed with Platanus, which scaffolds the assembled contigs and further closes gaps with insert size and sequence information from short paired-end libraries. Subsequently, a second level of scaffolding was accomplished with long Nanopore reads using LINKS (Warren et al., 2015), which was run for 20 iterations with multiple distance values (d) and step of sliding window (t), in addition to set values for k-mer (-k 19), minimum number of links (-l 5) and maximum link ratio between two best pairs (-a 0.3). Detailed parameters used in each iteration is available as Data Sheet 1. Resulting scaffolds were polished with pilon v1.22 (--fix all) (Walker et al., 2014) for five iterations. A third scaffolding step was performed using C. quadricarinatus RNA-seq reads previously generated (ERP004477) (Tan et al., 2016). HISAT2 was used to align RNA-seq reads to the assembly, information from which was used by BESST (Sahlin et al., 2014) for further scaffolding. All assemblies were evaluated for ‘completeness’ based on the detection of single copy conserved genes (arthropoda _odb9) with BUSCO (Sim & #227;o et al., 2015).2.3 Genome size estimationJellyfish (Mar & #231;ais and Kingsford, 2011) was used to count the occurrence of 19-, 21- and 25-mers in pre-processed short reads, generating a k-mer frequency histogram that was uploaded to the GenomeScope webserver (max kmer coverage disabled) (Vurture et al., 2017) for an estimation of haploid genome size, heterozygosity and repetitive content.2.4 Gene prediction and functional annotationA first iteration of the MAKER v2.31.10 annotation pipeline (Cantarel et al., 2008) was run to produce initial gene models based on transcript and protein hints (est2genome=1; protein2genome=1) from C. quadricarinatus transcriptome sequences (Tan et al., 2016), protein sequences from UniProt-SwissProt (Consortium, 2018) and an additional set of proteins from four other published decapod genomes: Eriocheir sinensis (Song et al., 2016), Litopenaeus vannamei (Zhang et al., 2019), Marsupenaeus japonicus and Penaeus monodon (Yuan et al., 2018). These gene models were used to train two ab initio gene predictors, SNAP (Korf, 2004) and AUGUSTUS (Stanke et al., 2006), which were provided in a second MAKER iteration. Gene models resulting from this iteration were again used to retrain SNAP and AUGUSTUS before a third and final iteration of MAKER. Genes with Annotation Edit Distance values (AED) ≤ 0.5 were retained (Eilbeck et al., 2009). A small AED value points to a lesser degree of variance between the predicted gene and evidences/hints used in prediction. For functional annotation, DIAMOND (Buchfink et al., 2014) was used to find homology between the predicted genes and known proteins in the UniProtKB (Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL) database (Consortium, 2018). The predicted protein sequences were also scanned for motifs, signatures and protein domains using InterProScan (Jones et al., 2014).2.5 Comparative analyses of published decapod genomesPublicly-available genome assemblies for seven published decapod species (Eriocheir sinensis, Exopalaemon carinicauda, Litopenaeus vannamei, Marsupenaeus japonicus, Neocaridina denticulata, Penaeus monodon, Procambarus virginalis) (Kenny et al., 2014; Song et al., 2016; Gutekunst et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019) and three other non-decapod crustaceans (Daphnia pulex, Eulimnadia texana, Parhyale hawaiensis) (Colbourne et al., 2011; Kao et al., 2016; Baldwin-Brown et al., 2017) were downloaded (sources in Table 1) and compared in terms of genome and assembly sizes, repeat content and completeness. ‘Completeness’ of a genome was assessed with BUSCO (Sim & #227;o et al., 2015) based on the arthropoda _odb9 databases. To obtain repeat profiles, repeat families were identified de novo using RepeatModeler (Smit and Hubley, 2019), which uses RepeatScout (Price et al., 2005) and RECON (Bao and Eddy, 2002) to scan for repeats. The output from this step contains a set of consensus sequences from each identified repeat family that was used by RepeatMasker (Smit et al., 2019) to mask repeats within the assembly.2.6 Preliminary detection of NUMTsThe eight assembled genomes for C. quadricarinatus, Er. sinensis, Ex. carinicauda, L. vannamei, M. japonicus, N. denticulata, Pe. monodon and Pr. virginalis were also scanned for the presence of putative NUMTs. The blastn tool (Altschul et al., 1990) was used to align the mitochondrial cox1 gene of each species to its corresponding genome (exception: Procambarus clarkii cox1 was used since the full cox1 sequence for Pr. virginalis is unavailable on NCBI). Each output was filtered to eliminate alignments based on the following criteria:1. Alignment length &lt; 100 nucleotides2. Alignment length that spans 95 % of a genomic scaffold3. Alignment at the edge of a genomic scaffoldAn illustration of how these filters were applied is provided in Data Sheet 6. Sequences of these putative NUMTs were extracted based on alignment start and stop coordinates and were aligned with MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013). IQ-TREE (Nguyen et al., 2014) was used to perform model testing and construct a maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree (-m TESTMERGE).2.7 Phylogenetic analysesA ML tree was also constructed based on orthologous protein sequences predicted by BUSCO. This tree consists of six decapods (C. quadricarinatus, Er. sinensis, L. vannamei, M. japonicus, Pe. monodon, Pr. virginalis) with D. pulex, Eu. texana and Pa. hawaiensis as non-decapod outgroup species, rooted with Drosophila melanogaster. Since this analysis used sequences predicted by BUSCO, N. denticulata and Ex. carinicauda with low BUSCO completeness were excluded from this analysis. Briefly, protein sequences within each orthologous group (based on metazoa _odb9 and arthropoda _odb9) were aligned with MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and trimmed with Gblocks (Castresana, 2000). Only multiple sequence alignments containing sequences from all ten species were retained and concatenated into a supermatrix with FASconCat-G (K & #252;ck and Longo, 2014). IQ-TREE (Nguyen et al., 2014) was used for initial model testing and construction of the ML tree (-m TESTMERGE), with support values indicated by the SH-like approximate likelihood ratio test (SH-aLRT) (Guindon et al., 2010) and ultrafast bootstrap (UFBoot) (Minh et al., 2013) (-alrt 1000 -bb 1000).3. Results and Discussion3.1 A giant genome for a large freshwater crayfishThis study produced 191 Gbp of HiSeq data (2 & #215;100 bp) and 774 Gbp of NovaSeq data (2 & #215;150 bp) in addition to 36 Gbp of Nanopore reads (average: 3,419 bp) to assist with scaffolding. Kmer-based methods estimated a 5 Gbp size for the Cherax quadricarinatus genome (Data Sheet 2), a value that is within the 3.82 to 6.06 Gbp size range that has been reported for species in the Infraorder Astacidea (Gregory, 2019) (Figure 1A). Based on this estimate, data generated in this study yields sequencing depths of 193 & #215; and 7 & #215; of short and long reads, respectively. Sequence data is available in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) on NCBI (BioProject: PRJNA559771).3.2 Characteristics of the C. quadricarinatus genomeHybrid assembly of this genome resulted in a 3.24 Gbp final assembly contained in 508,682 scaffolds, with a N50 length of 33,235 bp (Table 1). Details of each assembly at each scaffolding level are available in Data Sheet 3. The BUSCO tool reports the presence of 81.3 % and 12.8 % of complete and fragmented arthropod BUSCOs, respectively. These values are comparable to the completeness evaluation of other recently sequenced decapod genomes that are relatively much smaller (L. vannamei, Pr. virginalis, Er. sinensis) (Table 1, Figure 1B). GenomeScope profiles display a small shoulder on k-mer distributions, indicating some level of heterozygosity within the genome and estimated an average heterozygosity level of 0.44 %, which translates into approximately 1 mutation in 230 bp (Data Sheet 2). This is on par with the heterozygosity level of 0.53 % reported for the marbled crayfish, Pr. virginalis (Gutekunst et al., 2018), and is higher than in prawns with both M. japonicus and Pe. Monodon, both with 0.19 % and 0.21 % heterozygosity, respectively (Yuan et al., 2018). In addition, 33.73 % of this assembly was masked for repeats, with a large proportion of interspersed repeats being long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), representing a repeat profile that is similar to that of Pr. virginalis, another crayfish species (Figure 1C). While the report of only 5.9 % missing BUSCO genes in this C. quadricarinatus assembly suggests that majority of the gene space is present, the assembly reported in this study makes up only 64.8 % of the expected 5 Gbp genome with 85.2 % of short reads successfully mapped back to the assembly, indicating that there remains regions of this large genome that are missing from the assembly. This is not unusual for decapod genomes as they are rarely assembled to their full size, as seen from data points in Figure 1A, which mostly fall well below the “line of identity” between assembly vs genome size. The exception being Pr. virginalis with an assembled size close to its 3.5 Gbp genome size. This study tackles the ambitious assembly of a gigantic genome riddled with large repetitive structures and heterozygous regions that pose serious challenges to computational and bioinformatic resources, but there are clear benefits to hybrid assembly as an efficient method to add to the limited pool of genomic resources available for the order Decapoda. This assembly is available on NCBI (BioProject: PRJNA559771, WGS: VSFE00000000). It is noteworthy that this study has incorporated the largest dataset of long Nanopore reads to date for a decapod genome assembly (36 Gbp, { textasciitilde}7 & #215;), the other being the recent updated assembly of the black tiger prawn genome that incorporated the use of 2.5 Gbp of long Nanopore reads ({ textasciitilde}1.25 & #215;) (Van Quyen et al., 2020). The only other study to use long reads in decapod whole genome research is by Zhang et al. (2019) who utilised PacBio reads to support the assembly of the genome for the Pacific white shrimp L. vannamei.3.3 Predicted genes and functionalAn average of 95.4 % of RNA-seq reads from five C. quadricarinatus tissue types in Tan et al. (2016) were successfully aligned to the assembly. The annotation process predicted a total of 19,494 protein-coding genes (Data Sheet 3), with an average gene length of 9,768 bp containing an average of 4.4 exons per gene. This number of predicted genes is within the range of that typically reported for other decapod crustaceans (Er. sinensis: 14436, M. japonicus: 16716, Pe. monodon: 18100, Pr. virginalis: 21772, L. vannamei: 25596). Of the annotated protein-coding genes, 88 % are functionally annotated based on homology to existing UniProt protein sequences or through identification of protein domains and signatures. Protein and transcript sequences, BLAST homology alignments and InterProScan results are available as Data Sheet 4.3.4 Decapod evolution based on nuclear genesAlignment and trimming of 97 orthologous genes resulted in a supermatrix of 16,679 amino acid characters. Maximum-likelihood analysis based on these protein sequences generated the tree shown in Figure 1D. Rooted with the fruit fly, the phylogeny recovers branchiopods and amphipods as outgroup species to the decapod species. Shrimp and prawn species (L. vannamei, M. japonicus, Pe. monodon) are clustered in a clade as the Dendrobranchiata, which in turn forms a sister relationship with a second clade consisting of the other three decapod species. In this latter clade, crayfish species are placed as sister taxa (C. quadricarinatus and Pr. virginalis), consistent with their taxonomic status as species within Astacidea, but with surprisingly weak nodal support (SH-aLRT 55.1 %, UFBoot 66.0 %). These relationships are consistent with findings reported in mitogenome- and nuclear-based studies (Bracken et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2013; Tan et al., 2019; Wolfe et al., 2019). Alignment and phylogenetic tree produced in this analysis are available as Data Sheet 5.3.5 Integration of the mitochondrial cox1 gene into decapod genomesThe concept of DNA barcoding, by which a short universal DNA sequence is used to discriminate among species, is being very widely used to support taxonomic identification, detection of cryptic species and for establishing a reference database to support ecological, biodiversity and conservation-related studies (Ratnasingham and Hebert, 2007). A relatively recent and potentially powerful application of barcoding is the use of the rapidly increasing COI database as a reference for supporting environmental DNA metabarcoding studies (Deiner et al., 2017; G & #252;nther et al., 2018). However, DNA barcoding has its critics (Moritz and Cicero, 2004; Collins and Cruickshank, 2013), with a persistent concern being the impact of mitochondrial DNA copies in the nuclear genome (Bensasson et al., 2001; Hazkani-Covo et al., 2010) on the veracity of the DNA barcoding methodology, potentially making DNA barcoding unreliable for certain taxonomic groups (Sorenson and Quinn, 1998), including crustaceans (Song et al., 2008).NUMTs have now been reported in a diversity of animal groups including crustaceans, with cytochrome oxidase 1 (cox1) NUMTs found in planktonic copepods (Bucklin et al., 1999) and snapping shrimp (Williams and Knowlton, 2001). Nguyen et al. (2002) and Munasinghe et al. (2003) reported the first NUMTs for crayfish, from the genus Cherax, and Song et al. (2008) for species of Orconectes. Our study extends the findings of Song et al. (2008) in that we identify cox1 pseudogenes in each of the decapod genome assemblies we have examined, but find the number to be widely variable among taxa. This analysis identified the most cox1 pseudogenes in C. quadricarinatus (34 insertion sites), followed by Pe. monodon (11), Pr. virginalis (8), M. japonicus (6), Ex. carinicauda (5), N. denticulata (3), Er. sinensis (2) and L. vannamei (1) (Figure 1E). NUMTs identified from these decapod species form monophyletic groups by species in the phylogeny, suggesting that the cox1 mitochondrial gene was integrated into each nuclear genome subsequent to the divergence of species in this analysis, with either multiple independent transfer events or further evolution of NUMTs within each species through duplication events. The NUMT phylogenetic tree is available in Data Sheet 5.In a broad-based study of NUMTs in 85 eukaryotic genomes, Hazkani-Covo et al. (2010) found a correlation with genome size. While finding the highest number of NUMTs in the red claw crayfish, with the second largest decapod genome assembled, is consistent with this observation, the evidence for a similar overall trend is not so clear across all the decapod species. In this context, it should be noted that we only have a relatively small sampling of decapod genomes and the varying assembly quality and volume of sequence data among studies makes testing this hypothesis fraught at this stage. There are also several caveats associated with this analysis. The identification process is dependent on the search methods and implemented filters, which if too conservative, can limit detection and exclude true NUMTs with highly divergent and variable sequences, especially if the time of insertion form the mitogenome occurred millions of years ago (Tsuji et al., 2012). It is also unknown whether other published decapod studies have been post-processed to exclude scaffolds containing mitochondrial genes during the submission process to databases. Nevertheless, results from this analysis provide an insight into the prevalence of NUMTs in decapod genomes, encouraging further exploration into the evolution of NUMTs in future studies.4. ConclusionFollowing on from mitogenomic and transcriptomic studies, we present the first draft genome for the red claw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) based on relatively large volumes of short and long genomic reads from Illumina and Oxford Nanopore (ONT) platforms. While the assembly is relatively fragmented, it is much better than many of those currently available for decapod species, and the quality of the annotation is equivalent to other more recently-sequenced decapod genomes. Due to the very large size and repetitive structures of the red claw genome, the assembly was highly challenging. However, we demonstrated the value of long Nanopore reads and a hybrid assembly approach for improving an assembly based on short reads alone (Data Sheet 3), which gives encouragement for tackling other crayfish and crustacean taxa with large and complex genomes. This draft genome will be an important and valuable resource to support ongoing comparative genomic, phylogenomics and molecular-based breeding studies for aquaculture, conservation and biodiversity-related studies and can be approved upon over time, with the generation of additional long read data. However, a major challenge still remains in relation to the computational resources needed to assemble large repetitive genomes from predominately short reads, even when aided with long reads (Lewin et al., 2018). Computationally, assembly, scaffolding and polishing processes to achieve the final draft genome took almost 85 processor-weeks, and annotation required another 100 processor-weeks. A worthwhile next step would be to investigate the efficacy of a long-read led crayfish genome assembly, now feasible as result of declining costs and improved accuracy of long read sequencing, and which should be less expensive and lead to greatly reduced processor time for assembly tasks.Data availabilityThe datasets generated for this study can be found in the NCBI BioProject PRJNA559771, BioSamples SAMN12558911 and SAMN12885547 (WGS accession: VSFE00000000; SRA accessions: SRR10214688, SRR10416208, SRR10416210, SRR10445782, SRR10445783, SRR10445784, SRR10484712).Author ContributionsCA, HG and LC conceived the project.

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide released in the atmosphere and dissolved in water leads to acidification. Relatively few studies have focused on fresh waters, where biocalcifying species are more readily impacted by changes in pH. Sensitivity to pH of an endangered calcium-demanding organism, the crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, was investigated in the Pinail nature reserve, a natural system with 3000 permanent ponds, some inhabited by the crayfish and others not, originally due to human introduction. From the 14 chemical parameters measured in this study, the main limiting factor preventing crayfish establishment appears to be water acidity (pH { textless} 6.8), which affects calcification, molting, growth and reproduction. We predict that 20 % of the Pinail populations will disappear by 2060 due to freshwater acidification with the present level of fossil fuel consumption. Ongoing and future restoration projects for conservation of this heritage crustacean must select hard water with the highest water pH ({ textgreater} 7).},

Here, we assess the population differentiation in the Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, listed in Annex II of the European Habitats Directive, to provide valuable information for its conservation in Normandy (France). 2. Samples collected from 10 natural sites revealed that 13 of 14 microsatellite loci were polymorphic. Significant differentiation among populations was detected (FST = 0.054, P { textless} 0.001), and all FST pairwise comparisons except one were significant. A genetic split was observed between populations inhabiting streams with limestone geology compared to those inhabiting streams with siliceous geology, which could reflect adaptative differences. 3. Hatchery stocks used for the restocking of two rivers were genetically distinct from native stocks. 4. Analysis of three stream habitats restored in 1995 showed that all were recolonized naturally by wild salmon from geographically close populations and no founder effects were detected. Allelic richness was similar between recolonized and wild populations. 5. From a management perspective, our study revealed that restoration of habitat is very effective to recreate new populations in rivers from which salmon have disappeared and that natural recolonization can be fast and effective in terms of genetic diversity.},

Eight populations of A. i. italicus, analyzed for their microsatellite loci, showed a low intra-population genetic variability and a high inter-population genetic divergence. Populations sampled in the Sieve basin showed no heterozygotes and a high level of inbreeding.

Ten populations of Austropotamobius italicus from the Marches region (Central Italy), two populations from the Appennines of Calabria and Basilicata (Southern Italy) and four populations from Friuli Venezia Giulia region were sampled to elucidate the geographical pattern of genetic variability in relation to recent and historical factors. 2. A total of nine COI haplotypes belonging to three separate lineages have been characterized. Both lineage A (Northern Marches region) and C (Friuli Venezia Giulia region) were represented by one haplotype and were related to the Istria 1 peninsula and SouthAlps/Western Balkans lineages respectively. The lineage B included seven haplotypes belonging to the Appenines lineage. 3. Two hypotheses on the origin of individuals belonging to the Istrian lineage in Marches are discussed: (i) a natural colonization from the Istria peninsula refugia by migrating westwards across the bridge between the Istria peninsula and Italy, (ii) an anthropogenic origin. Based on 16S rRNA sequences, the taxonomic status of lineage B and C, defined from COI mtDNA markers, belongs to A. i. meridionalis and that of lineage A belongs to A. i. carsicus. The existence of a complex geographic structure between Marches populations (Φst=0.66) of A. i. meridionalis should be further considered in conservation management.

The first feminizing factor (F) is a Wolbachia and the other (f) is probably a sequence of the F bacterial DNA unstably integrated into the host genome. Both of these feminizing factors are mainly maternally transmitted. Here we investigate the mitochondrial DNA polymorphism of wild iso-female lineages harbouring either F or f. Among the four haplotypes present in the population, two were the f-harbouring lineages, while two were common to the F- and f-harbouring lineages. This result suggests that there has been an introgression of the f factor into lineages infected by F Wolbachia. Based on previous data, we propose two different ways to account for such introgression. Given the particular dynamics of feminizing factors (f-harbouring lineages increase in populations at the expense of F-harbouring lineages), such an introgression should prevent the replacement of F-linked mitochondrial types by f-linked mitochondrial types in wild populations.},

These brooks run through pastoral areas with well-developed riparian vegetation, which offers an important shade. Water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, and conductivity fell within the ranges found for this species. A total of 34, 31, 29 taxa and 1 502, 1 364, 2 707 individuals of macrobenthos were collected in Holme, Besque and Bellecombe streams, respectively. Results showed good to very good water quality with IBGN scores ranging from 15 (Bellecombe) to 17 (Holme and Besque), reflecting a limited impact of the anthropogenic disturbances. Taxa diversity were high for Holme and Besque with Shannon index around 3.2, translating a great heterogeneity of habitat and an equilibrated faunal community. Bellecombe showed a limited diversity with Shannon index of 1.42, resulting from the presence of numberous Chironomidae. This brook suffers probably weak organic pollution which could be related to the low water flow observed during the sampling. The similarity test according to Jaccard index showed high percentage of common taxa among ETP (Ephemeroptera-Trichoptera-Plecoptera) between all sites. The high similarity of benthic macroinvertebrate communities could be an useful criteria to identify brooks for restocking purpose.},

Drawing on both morphological and genetic data, this paper describes the Iguana populations from Saba and Montserrat as a new species, Iguana melanoderma. This species is recognized on the basis of the following combination of characteristics: private microsatellite alleles, unique mitochondrial ND4 haplotypes, a distinctive black spot between the eye and tympanum, a dorsal carpet pattern on juveniles and young adults, a darkening of body coloration with aging (except for the anterior part of the snout), a black dewlap, pink on the jowl, the high number of large tubercular nape scales, fewer than ten medium sized–triangular dewlap spikes, high dorsal spikes, and lack of horns on the snout. This new melanistic taxon is threatened by unsustainable harvesting (including for the pet trade) and both competition and hybridization from escaped or released invasive alien iguanas (I. iguana iguana and I. rhinolopha) from South and Central America, respectively. The authors call for action to conserve Iguana melanoderma in Saba and Montserrat and for further research to investigate its relationship to other melanistic iguanas from the Virgin Islands and coastal islands of Venezuela.},

Most of the disappearances of crayfish are unexplained. For the 22 others, the main reasons of the disappearance of indigenous crayfish populations were due to (1) habitat destruction by channelisation, (2) decrease of water quality by use of agricultural chemicals, (3) the construction of ponds or lakes changing the physical and chemical parameters of brooks inhabited by indigenous crayfish, (4) the introduction of non-indigenous species, mainly P. leniusculus and recently (5) crayfish plague implicated and characterized in the disappearance of two populations, two additional ones being suspected.

The spread of feminizing Wolbachia within and across populations is therefore expected to influence mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genetic structure by hitchhiking. To test this hypothesis, we analysed nuclear and mtDNA genetic structure, and Wolbachia prevalence in 13 populations of the pill bug host. Wolbachia prevalence (ranging from 0 % to 100 % of sampled females) was highly variable among populations. All three Wolbachia strains previously observed in A.vulgare were present (wVulC, wVulM and wVulP) with wVulC being the most prevalent (nine of 13 populations). The host showed a genetic structure on five microsatellite loci that is compatible with isolation by distance. The strong genetic structure observed on host mtDNA was correlated with Wolbachia prevalence: three mitotypes were in strong linkage disequilibrium with the three strains of Wolbachia. Neutrality tests showed that the mtDNA polymorphism is not neutral, and we thus suggest that this unusual pattern of mtDNA polymorphism found in A.vulgare was due to Wolbachia.},

	abstract = {Pontastacus leptodactylus is a native European crayfish species found in both freshwater and brackish environments. It has commercial importance for fisheries and aquaculture industries. Up till now, most studies concerning P. leptodactylus have focused onto gaining knowledge about its phylogeny and population genetics. However, little is known about chromosomal evolution and genome organization of this species. Therefore, we performed clustering analysis of a low coverage genomic dataset to identify and characterize repetitive DNA in the P. leptodactylus genome. In addition, the karyogram of P. leptodactylus (2n = 180) is presented here for the first time consisting of 72 75 metacentric, 18 14 submetacentric and a submetacentric/metacentric heteromorphic chromosome pair. We determined the genome size at approximately 18.7 gigabase pairs. Repetitive DNA represents about 54.85 % of the genome. Satellite DNA repeats are the most abundant type of repetitive DNA, making up to { textasciitilde}28 % of the total amount of repetitive elements, followed by the Ty3/Gypsy retroelements ({ textasciitilde}15 %). Our study established surprisingly high diversity of satellite repeats in P. leptodactylus. The genome of P. leptodactylus is by far the most satellite-rich genome discovered to date with 258 satellite families described. Of the five mapped satellite DNA families on chromosomes, PlSAT3-411 co-localizes with the AT-rich DAPI positive probable (peri)centromeric heterochromatin on all chromosomes, while PlSAT14-79 co-localizes with the AT-rich DAPI positive (peri)centromeric heterochromatin on someone chromosomees and is also located subterminally and intercalary on some chromosomes. PlSAT1-21 is located intercalary in the vicinity of the (peri)centromeric heterochromatin on some chromosomes, while PlSAT6-70 , PlSAT14-79 and PlSAT7-134 are located subterminally and intercalary on most ofsome P. leptodactylus chromosomes. The FISH results reveal amplification of interstitial telomeric repeats (ITRs) in P. leptodactylus. The prevalence of repetitive elements, especially the satellite DNA repeats, may have provided a driving force for the evolution of the P. leptodactylus genome.},

	abstract = {Introductions of invasive non-native species (and their subsequent impacts) are recognized as a major threat to native flora and fauna. This is especially true in island ecosystems such as the tropical island of Martinique. In 2018, one such aquatic invasive species, the suckermouth catfish Hypostomus robinii (Loricariidae), was reported for the first time in two of the islands rivers. H. robinii is a popular freshwater aquarium fish and native to tropical and sub-tropical South America. Since its initial discovery, a growing number of populations have been found, suggesting a larger distribution of this species through Martinique's hydrographic network. Here, we developed a novel survey technique (utilizing environmental DNA) and conducted a widespread survey across the island to assess the distribution of this invasive species. We were able to detect H. robinii in 22 % of sites surveyed (18 out of 83) via our eDNA-based assay. The presence of these fish was confirmed using traditional trapping at 14 of these sites. Additionally, we used occupancy modeling to investigate the impact of different environmental covariates on the detection efficiency of the novel assay and the potential impacts of false positives and negatives. We highlight a decrease in the detection probability when water volume filtered increases. That said, the eDNA-based method proves a useful tool for the detection of this invasive fish species and monitoring its spread for management purposes.},

The puberal moult was identified by changes in the relative growth of CW (claw width) and CL (claw length) in both sexes. Males have shown variation of the relative growth of CW and CL at 19.15 mm of POL for the Gatineau (Gat) stream, 20.1 mm of POL for the Magnerolle (Mag) and 20.3 mm for the Fontaine Saint-Pierre (Fsp) populations, respectively. Sexual maturity of females occurred at 16.17 mm POL for the Fsp, 18.2 mm for the Mag and for the Gat. Geographic variation in A. pallipes was investigated using multivariate analysis of five morphometric characters on mature specimens. By canonical discriminant analysis, the Mag population was distinct from the other two populations. Results are discussed with regard to restocking strategy.},

	abstract = {Aphanomyces astaci causes crayfish plague in European freshwater crayfish, but most historical epizootics lack agent isolation and identification. Although declared as crayfish plague outbreaks by the Norwegian Competent Authorities, only presumptive diagnoses without agent isolation exist from Norwegian epizootics until 2005. Molecular methods now allow both A. astaci detection and genotype determination from preserved samples. We therefore aimed to (1) investigate molecularly if A. astaci was involved in a selection of mass-mortality events in Norwegian noble crayfish populations from 1971 to 2004, and (2) determine the eventually involved A. astaci genotype groups both from these historical and also more recent mass-mortality events. DNA was extracted directly from presumptively infected crayfish tissues, and screened by A. astaci specific qPCR. A representative selection of positive samples was confirmed by ITS-sequencing. Finally, genotype determination was performed with microsatellite markers that distinguish all known A. astaci genotype groups. The molecular examination detected A. astaci in crayfish materials from all examined mass-mortality events. The first event in 1971–1974 was caused by the A. astaci genotype group A, presumably the first genotype group that entered Europe more than 150 years ago. All later outbreaks were caused by the A. astaci genotype group B which was introduced to Europe by importation of signal crayfish in the 1960s. The results suggest that molecular methods can verify the involvement of A. astaci in the vast majority of observed crayfish mass mortalities in Europe whenever preserved materials exist. Moreover, microsatellite genotyping can reveal at least parts of the underlying epidemiology.},

Therefore, designing and modelling ecological networks to identify biodiversity reservoirs and their corridors are crucial aspects of land management in terms of population persistence and survival. However, the land cover/use maps used for landscape connectivity modelling can lack information in such a highly complex environment. In this context, remote sensing approaches are gaining interest for the development of accurate land cover/use maps. We tested the efficiency of an object-based classification using open-source projects and free images to identify vegetation strata at a very fine scale and evaluated its contribution to landscape connectivity modelling. We compared different spatial and thematic resolutions from existing databases and object-based image analyses in three French cities. Our results suggested that this remote sensing approach produced reliable land cover maps to differentiate artificial areas, tree vegetation and herbaceous vegetation. Land cover maps enhanced with the remote sensing products substantially changed the structural connectivity indices, showing an improvement up to four times the proportion of herbaceous and tree vegetation. In addition, functional connectivity indices evaluated for several forest species were mainly impacted for medium dispersers in quantitative (metrics) and qualitative (corridors) estimations. Thus, the combination of this reproductible remote sensing approach and landscape connectivity modelling at a very fine scale provides new insights into the characterisation of ecological networks for conservation planning.},

The widespread A. euteiches and A. cochlioides induce root rot diseases in leguminous species and sugar beet respectively. The fish pathogen A. invadans is the causative agent of Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome in various fish species whilst A. astaci infects crayfishes causing crayfish plague.

	abstract = {The Lesser Antilles, in the Eastern Caribbean, were long considered to have only two species in the genus Iguana Laurenti 1768: the Lesser Antillean iguana Iguana delicatissima, which is endemic to parts of the Lesser Antilles, and the Common green iguana Iguana iguana, which also occurs throughout Central and South America. No subspecies are currently recognised. However, herpetologists and reptile collectors have pointed out strong physical differences between some of the island populations of Iguana iguana and those from the continent. Drawing on both morphological and genetic data, this paper describes two subspecies of the Common green iguana Iguana iguana from the southern Lesser Antilles, specifically the countries of Saint Lucia Iguana iguana sanctaluciae and Iguana iguana insularis from St Vincent &amp; the Grenadines, and Grenada. The form on the island of Saint Vincent has not been identified. The new subspecies are described based on the following unique combination of characters: Presence of high median and medium to small lateral horns on the snout; Small subtympanic plate not exceeding 20 % of the eardrum size; Two or three scales of decreasing size anterior to the subtympanic plate; Fewer than ten small to medium triangular gular spikes; Medium sized dewlap; Low number of small to medium dispersed nuchal tubercles; Dark brown iris, with the white of the eye visible; Oval, prominent nostril; Short and relatively flat head; High dorsal spines; No swelling of the jowls in reproductively active males. Iguana iguana sanctaluciae has in adults vertical black stripes on body and tail and a black dewlap whereas Iguana iguana insularis is pale grey or creamy white in adults. Both subspecies are globally threatened by unsustainable hunting (including the pet trade) and by invasive alien species, including hybridization from invasive iguanas from South and Central America (I. iguana iguana and I. rhinolopha, considered here as full species) that have become established in all three countries. The authors call for stronger measures to conserve the remaining purebred Iguana i. insularis and Iguana i. sanctaluciae ssp. nov. throughout their ranges and for further research to identify other cryptic species and subspecies of Iguana in the Lesser Antilles.},

	abstract = {Aphanomyces astaci, the crayfish plague pathogen, is responsible for mass mortalities in native European crayfish stocks. Itspersistence and spread across Europe has been facilitated by the presence of invasive North American crayfish species, which act as asymptomatic vectors of this pathogen. In France, some recent mass mortalities have involved the pathogenic strain harbouredby the invasive signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus, which may share habitats with the autochthonous white-clawed crayfish, Austropotamobius pallipes. To improve the efficiency of conservation management of A. pallipes, we have (i) updated information on the distribution of P. leniusculus populations in France based on data collected by the ONEMA (French National Agency for Water and Aquatic Environments), (ii) studied the distribution and prevalence of the crayfish plague pathogen within P. leniusculus populations throughout the country, and finally (iii) genotyped the strains responsible for several recent mass mortalities in A. pallipes populations. In total, 1658 populations of the signal crayfish were recorded in France; 1554 of these in streams and 104 in ponds. In 2014, this species was present in 80 of 95 French departments. Among the 1131 analyzed P. leniusculus individuals from 94 localities, 255 individuals (23 %) tested positive for A. astaci presence. Infected individuals were detected in 63 % of studied populations. Local prevalence varied highly among populations, ranging from 0 % (no detection of A.astaci) up to 90 % in the most infected ones. Out of five mass mortalities characterized in France in 2014–2015, four involved the strain from genotype group B, specific to P. lenisuculus. Our results confirm that the widespread signal crayfish serves as a key reservoir of A. astaci in France and therefore represents a serious danger for native crayfish species, especially the white-clawed crayfish.},

The species was mostly found in the center and northern part of the island, specifically, a total of 105 specimens were captured in eight streams and five closed water bodies. We sequenced a 491 base-pair fragment of the COI gene to understand the invasion history and pathway from the presumed source population at the Mangatal hatchery. Among the eight haplotypes found, three were dominant, of which, two occurred in the Mangatal hatchery.

	abstract = {1. Habitat fragmentation of stream ecosystems often results in decreased connectivity between populations and lower population sizes. Hence, understanding how habitat fragmentation affects genetic erosion is important for the preservation of freshwater biodiversity, in particular, as small populations suffer from loss of genetic diversity through genetic drift and loss of fitness because of inbreeding, increasing the risk of extinction. 2. Here, we assess the impact of demographic factors on population differentiation in the endangered freshwater crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes by analysing population genetic structure, estimating effective population sizes and comparing levels of polymorphism at five microsatellite loci with density estimates of 10 populations within a small French catchment that has become progressively confined to headwaters over the last six decades. 3. Levels of expected heterozygosity and allelic richness per population were relatively low (0.214–0.396 and 1.6–2.6, respectively). We found strong genetic differentiation between these geographically close populations (FST = 0.283), with weak statistical evidence for a pattern of isolation by distance. Estimates of effective population size were low ({ textless}150) in most populations, but potentially reached several thousands in three populations. 4. Population density and allelic richness were strongly positively correlated. A robust relationship between population density and heterozygosity values was also noted, but only after discarding two populations for which significant genetic signatures of a recent bottleneck were found; these two populations displayed high expected heterozygosity compared with a very low density. Populations with the highest densities of individuals had the highest effective population size estimates and vice versa. 5. Our results clearly show the importance of demographic factors and genetic drift on A. pallipes populations. Furthermore, analysis of genetic and population density data is a pragmatic and efficient approach to corroborate inferences from genetic data and can be particularly useful in the identification of populations experiencing a bottleneck and therefore in conservation genetics studies aiming at identifying priority populations for conservation.},

	abstract = {The signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus, native to northwestern North America, has become the most widespread invasive crayfish species in Europe. It has been introduced repeatedly since 1959, and altogether { textgreater}60,000 individuals were imported. Secondary introductions across the continent followed, resulting in its current presence in ≥26 European countries. Recent studies indicate that multiple highly divergent lineages of signal crayfish exist in its North American range, and previous investigators have suggested that { textgreater}1 signal crayfish subspecies are present in Europe. We investigated its genetic variation by sequencing a fragment of the mitochondrial gene for cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) to clarify the diversity of this invasive species in its European range. We analyzed 348 signal crayfish from 68 European populations and compared the resulting patterns with reference sequences from North America. All European individuals studied fell within 1 clade of P. leniusculus, but we observed substantial variation at the analyzed marker. Altogether, we recorded 27 COI haplotypes (4 very widespread) in Europe, but no clear distributional pattern of these haplotypes corresponds to numerous secondary introductions across Europe. Maximum pairwise divergence at COI among haplotypes detected in Europe was up to 4 %. Such extent of genetic variation should be considered when developing and validating species-specific DNA-based probes for environmental detection of this invasive species because mitochondrial genes (and COI in particular) are often the markers of choice for this purpose.},

A growing number of studies have described the presence of different Wolbachia strains within a same host. To date, no naturally occurring multiple infections have been recorded in terrestrial isopods. This is true for Armadillidium vulgare which is known to harbor non simultaneously three Wolbachia strains. Traditionally, such Wolbachia are detected by PCR amplification of the wsp gene and strains are characterized by sequencing. The presence of nucleotide deletions or insertions within the wsp gene, among these three different strains, provides the opportunity to test a novel genotyping method. Herein, we designed a new primer pair able to amplify products whose lengths are specific to each Wolbachia strain so as to detect the presence of multi-infections in A. vulgare. Experimental injections of Wolbachia strains in Wolbachia-free females were used to validate the methodology. We re-investigated, using this novel method, the infection status of 40 females sampled in 2003 and previously described as mono-infected based on the classical sequencing method. Among these females, 29 were identified as bi-infected. It is the first time that naturally occuring multiple infections of Wolbachia are detected within an individual A. vulgare host. Additionally, we resampled 6 of these populations in 2010 to check the infection status of females.},

Test fishing has indicated that the abundance of signal crayfish has been fluctuating between years and among localities. It has had strong negative impact on abundance of one noble crayfish population. The disconnected distribution of signal crayfish strongly suggests that these populations are the result of human-assisted introductions. Real-time PCR analyses proved that signal crayfish carry the causative agent of the crayfish plague, an oomycete Aphanomyces astaci, thus contributing to its spread. Mortalities in noble crayfish populations had been caused by A. astaci strains from A, B and E genotype group.},

	abstract = {The white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes) is globally endangered due to the impacts of habitat modification and fragmentation, water pollution, climate change, and invasive species, particularly the signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus). These pressures have caused the decline of A. pallipes populations in Europe, demonstrating the importance of predicting the species' potential distribution under current and future conditions. Focusing on the watercourses of mainland France, we aimed to identify suitable areas for A. pallipes to guide the conservation of current populations and future introduction actions or protection measures. We applied ecological niche modelling to model the potential distribution of both A. pallipes and P. leniusculus and identified locations suitable for A. pallipes only. We also assessed the potential distribution of the species under two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios: RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, respectively describing low-warming and high-warming conditions. We found that A. pallipes and P. leniusculus exploit equivalent niches in France. Despite this, under current conditions, about 5 % of the study area simultaneously records a high suitability for A. pallipes and a low suitability for P. leniusculus and is therefore of significant conservation interest. This percentage remains relatively stable under RCP 2.6 for 2050 and 2100, but decreases to 2 % under RCP 8.5 for 2100. Ecological niche modelling can supply crucial guidance for conservation actions aimed at protecting endangered species at a national scale by identifying sites most suitable for protection and sites where climate change and invasive species constitute a threat.},

	abstract = {In the past, conservation programmes for a given species consisted in restoring the habitat and in translocating individuals without knowledge of their taxonomic status. Even if managers wanted to be informed, the “traditional taxonomy”, based on morphological characters, was discouraging because it could indicate several types of classification. This is the case for Austropotamobius pallipes, considered as a species complex.Today, conservation genetics aims to maintain, on one hand, the genetic specificity of populations (genetic integrity principle) and, on the other hand, the genetic diversity within and between populations (biodiversity principle), these basic principles being considered both at the level of protection measures and management measures. As an endangered species, A. pallipes is subjected to a loss of genetic diversity, a result of deterioration of water quality responsible for habitat fragmentation, with populations being confined to headwaters of the catchments. Consequently a certain degree of genetic variability must be maintained within the species because it governs the adaptation potential: the populations must be capable of responding to new environmental conditions.In A. pallipes, recent studies from several countries attempt to first describe the distribution of the present natural populations and secondly, by studying mitochondrial DNA, to clarify the taxonomy (number and identification of the present species and subspecies by phylogenetic inferences) and to assess the biogeographical history. These two preliminary steps are fundamental before defining conservation units and working at the catchment level, using highly polymorphic nuclear markers. The new approach has provided a good framework for research, with more frequent dialogues between geneticists and managers.},

Management decisions related to crayfish and their habitats require accurate, up-to-date distribution data and mapping tools. Such data are currently patchily distributed with limited accessibility and are rarely up-to-date. To address these challenges, we developed a versatile e-portal to host distributional data of freshwater crayfish and their pathogens (using Aphanomyces astaci, the causative agent of the crayfish plague, as the most prominent example). Populated with expert data and operating in near real-time, World of Crayfish™ is a living, publicly available database providing worldwide distributional data sourced by experts in the field. The database offers open access to the data through specialized standard geospatial services (Web Map Service, Web Feature Service) enabling users to view, embed, and download customizable outputs for various applications.

After reviewing the importance of characterizing the different genetic stocks (ESU: Evolutionary Significant Units) of a species, where morphological criteria used for taxonomy, are utilizable with caution, the present state of knowledge of the phylogeny of European species was determined, in particular for the genus Austropotamobius which occupies most studies. There was a lively debate on the elevation to species rank of A. italicus. The status of knowledge of the taxonomy of Astacus astacus has been presented. Finally, given a major increase in works describing the genetic variability of natural populations of European crayfish, it was evident that an up to date inventory of the different research teams in this field should be developed, for several reasons – (i) to describe these teams and their managers (thus facilitating contact) (ii) to list the species studied and the markers used (iii) to give some recommendations on standardizing the use of certain markers or genes so as to allow comparison between the results collected by the various teams, and to apply them on a broader geographic scale.},

This population occupied a 12 km stretch of the La Lucelle brook, with an estimated size of around 150 000 individuals. The presence of the crayfish plague pathogen was quickly diagnosed as the cause of the mortality, and monitoring was carried out to follow the spread of the disease from 15 July 2013 for one year. Results showed that after a fast spread between 15 and 25 July 2013 (upstream progression of mortality for about 4 km), the mortality front was limited to a stretch of a few hundred meters from August until December 2013. During winter, mortality was always observed, confirming that disease remained active. In April 2014, the mortality front was halted by a large dam in the brook (2 m high), 0.56 km from brook source. Two months later, 30 live crayfish were observed above the dam. On the 30 August 2014, no crayfish were found above the dam.

La taille de l'ADNmt est classique, d'environ 18 kb. L'analyse du polymorphisme de restriction a révélé une forte variabilité intraspécifique. Le pourcentage de divergence nucléotidique estimé entre les quatre haplotypes est compris entre 1,16 et 3,99 %. Ces données suggèrent que l'analyse par RFLP peut avoir une plus grande résolution que l'électrophorèse enzymatique dans l'identification des populations de l'écrevisse signal. Ce marqueur offre de nouvelles perspectives dans le domaine de l'aquaculture ainsi que pour la compréhension de la structure génétique et de la biologie évolutive des populations d'écrevisse. Summary: This study presents a revised method for the extraction of mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) from crayfish species of aquacultural interest, Pacifastacus leniusculus. The mean size of the mitochondrial genome is approximately 18 000 bp. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis performed on the mtDNA has revealed extensive genetic variability within this species. The estimated percentage of nucleotide sequence divergence among the four haplotypes found for P. leniusculus ranges from 1.16 to 3.99 %. These data suggest that RFLP analysis of mtDNA may provide greater resolution than protein electrophoresis for population identification among signal crayfish populations. This marker offers new avenues for aquaculture and for understanding the genetic structure and evolutionary history of crayfish populations.},

	abstract = {The white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes) is an emblematic taxon of European rivers, found mainly in oxygenated streams, known to be an excellent indicator of river quality. Since several decades, the population of A. pallipes declined in relation to anthropogenic pressure, habitat loss, and competition with pests (invasive crayfish, crayfish plague). This endangered species is now submitted to conservation strategies by freshwater managers in order to survey and protect the remaining populations. In France, traditional surveys in freshwater environments were performed by electric fishing, kick-net fishing, or trapping, particularly disruptive for the environment and very time-consuming. However, with the rise of molecular genetic technology, new methods based on the detection of environmental DNA (eDNA) have emerged. We present here the results of an optimized study for the detection of the endangered crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes in France, considering certain environmental co-factors and comparing two PCR methods (qPCR and ddPCR). After improving laboratory procedures, we were able to detect the presence of the crayfish up to 2 km downstream from a known point of presence and unfortunately highlight the disappearance of a historical population, after sampling two consecutive years. Such a level of precision is interesting because it makes it possible to precise the presence of specimens in a relatively restricted area and to orient traditional prospecting, necessary for certain additional studies. During our study, we observed better probabilities of detection during the summer period, but in a growing context of climate change, we advise to adapt the sampling year by year. That said, this methodology is a very useful tool for the detection of rare and/or endemic species and we did not observe any difference between the two PCR methods used.},

The genus Iguana, widely distributed throughout the Americas, is under threat by invasive species, hybridization, the global pet trade, and habitat destruction. This holds especially true for the insular lineages, with the Critically Endangered I. delicatissima having experienced a { textgreater}75 % range decrease, primarily through hybridization with non-native iguanas. We collated published microsatellite data and genotyped samples from new localities to construct a distribution-wide Iguana dataset built from 190 individuals for 17 microsatellite loci. This enabled us to identify patterns of genetic differentiation within and among populations, and identify key loci and private alleles for use in conservation management. Our analyses reveal clear separation between I. delicatissima and the I. iguana complex, highlighting the power of eight key microsatellite loci for the study of hybridization dynamics. Genetic differentiation within I. delicatissima identifies four clusters that aid decision making for conservation management action. Within the I. iguana complex, we increase mainland localities by 11-fold and recover 3.5 more alleles across all loci than previously known. Overall, we identify 112 (48 % private) and 76 (25 % private) alleles for mainland and island lineages, respectively. We highlight loci sets to identify (1) non-native or hybrid iguanas in insular populations and their genetic origin, and (2) genetic origin of insular iguanas in the global pet trade. Overall, we provide a reference for Iguana microsatellite loci in order to allow standardization and comparison among studies, aiding broader assessment of research and conservation hypotheses.},

A. vulgare is the major model for the study of Wolbachia-mediated feminization of genetic males in crustaceans. As a consequence of their impact on host sex determination mechanisms, Wolbachia endosymbionts are thought to significantly influence A. vulgare evolution on various grounds, including population genetic structure, diversity and reproduction strategies. To provide molecular tools for examining these questions, we isolated microsatellite loci through 454 pyrosequencing of a repeat-enriched A. vulgare genomic library. We selected 14 markers and developed three polymorphic microsatellite multiplex kits. We tested the kits on two A. vulgare natural populations and found high genetic variation, thereby making it possible to investigate the impact of Wolbachia endosymbionts on A. vulgare nuclear variation at unprecedented resolution. In addition, we tested the transferability of these kits by cross-species amplification in five other terrestrial isopod species harboring Wolbachia endosymbionts. The microsatellite loci showed good transferability in particular in Armadillidium nasatum and Chaetophiloscia elongata, for which these markers represent promising tools for future genetic studies.},

In some cases population transfers or reintroductions are carried out in lentic ecosystems such as ponds or quarries. Such conservation actions require rapid, low cost and powerful tools to census suitable habitat. Some species of the Characeae family (Chara spp.), share ecological needs with A. pallipes and are proposed as bioindicators of suitable habitat. Chara species were tested, among other plants, as bioindicators, and to see whether Chara species are a stronger indicator than water chemistry. The Pinail Nature Reserve, with 3000 permanent ponds, is inhabited by white-clawed crayfish probably introduced historically into ponds used for fish production. This allows a replicated study of suitable habitats where plant communities are bioindicators of crayfish presence. Crayfish presence is associated with Chara species (such as Chara aspera, Chara virgata, Chara fragifera, Chara polyacantha and Chara vulgaris). Austropotamobius pallipes is present in ponds with Chara spp. (N = 10/10) while other ponds without crayfish are lacking charophytes (N = 1/23). Algae of the genus Chara are thus a simple and low-cost additional tool for determining suitable habitat for crayfish introductions within enclosed waters protected from exotic invasive species and disease. Cladium mariscus also appears to be another useful bioindicator for crayfish habitat.},

Here, we assessed if a low-vagility newt, Triturus marmoratus, can track displacement of suitable areas by 2100, and tested whether climate or LULC changes are primary drivers of the species’ future distribution. We combined niche modelling with the process-based model simRShift to improve biological relevance and simulate species dispersal by 2100 under scenarios of climate and LULC changes at high spatial resolution. Our results show that T. marmoratus could lose a significant part of its current French range in the coming decades, and that the range loss will primarily be driven by climate change, with LULC change playing a secondary role. The species seems unlikely to be able to track the northern shift of its suitable habitat as rapidly as required given the rate of climate warming during the 21st century. This is due to insufficient dispersal ability, which is compounded by the magnitude of habitat fragmentation in the human-dominated landscape. We highlight the need to assess vulnerability and anticipate threats arising from global change even for species that are not currently considered endangered. We identified areas where the species is most likely to occur and be extinct in the future, which can serve as a guide for population monitoring. Our framework can support conservation strategy development by defining ecological corridors that would assist species to track their required habitats in the face of global change.},

Seventeen microsatellites were used to estimate genetic diversity, population structure and the level of introgression with other Iguana species over nearly the whole range of the species. ND4 and PAC sequences were also used to better characterize hybridization and to complete the description of this lineage. The I.insularis population of St. Vincent shows a high level of introgression from I.iguana whereas in the Grenadines, most islands present pure insularis populations but several show evidence of introgressions. Of the two remaining populations of I.insularis sanctaluciae, only one is still purebred. The recent identification of this and other distinct insular species and subspecies in the eastern Caribbean, and evaluation of where hybridization has occurred, are timely and important because the native iguanas are in urgent need of conservation action. Among the greatest threats is the ongoing human-mediated spread of invasive iguanas from Central and South America, which are destroying the endemic insular lineages through multiple diachronic introgression events.},

	abstract = {The redclaw crayfish, Cherax quadricarinatus, was introduced to Martinique Island for aquaculture purposes at the beginning of the 21st century, in an attempt to revitalize the freshwater crustacean aquaculture sector. Mainly due to its high economical value, it was intentionally released in the wild and was caught and sold by fishermen. Martinican rivers are polluted by chlordecone, considered as one of the worst Persistant Organic Pollutants (POP). Despite its dangerousness, it was used until 1993 in the French West Indies against a banana pest and was always found in the ecosystems. This study aimed to investigate the level of contamination in the muscle of crayfish caught in the wild, as well as the potential of bioconcentration and depuration in the C. quadricarinatus muscle. This study could allow us to quantify the risk for consumers but also, to evaluate a depuration process to reduce the risk related to its consumption. Using both in-vitro and in-situ experiments, results highlighted the importance of the chlordecone concentration in the water and the time of exposure to the pollutant. The bioconcentration seems to be very quick and continuous in crayfish muscle, as chlordecone can be detectable as early as 6 h of exposure, whatever the concentration tested. Finally, it appears that, even after 20 days of depuration in chlordecone-free water, chlordecone concentrations remained higher to the residual maximum limit (i.e. 20 ng/g wet weight), concluding that the decontamination of the muscle seems not very efficient, and the risk for the Martinican people could be serious.},

	abstract = {Low coverage genome sequencing is rapid and cost-effective for recovering complete mitochondrial genomes for crustacean phylogenomics. The recovery of high-copy-number nuclear genes, including histone H3, 18S and 28S ribosomal RNAs, is also possible using this approach based on our research with freshwater crayfishes (Astacidea). We explored the potential of genome skimming (GS) to recover additional nuclear genes from shallow sequencing projects using decapod crustaceans. Using an in silico-baited approach, we recovered three additional core histone genes (H2A, H2B, and H4) from our low-coverage decapod dataset (99 species, 69 genera, 38 families, 10 infraorders). Phylogenetic analyses using various combinations of mitochondrial and nuclear genes for the entire decapod dataset and a subset of 40 species of crayfishes showed that the evolutionary rates for different classes of genes varied widely. A very high level of congruence was nevertheless found between trees from the six nuclear genes and those derived from the mitogenome sequences for freshwater crayfish. These findings indicate that nuclear genes recovered from the same genome skimming datasets designed to obtain mitogenomes can be used to support more robust and comprehensive phylogenetic analyses. Further, a search for additional intron-less nuclear genes identified several high-copy-number genes across the decapod dataset, and recovery of NaK, PEPCK, and GAPDH gene fragments is possible at slightly elevated coverage, suggesting the potential and utility of GS in recovering even more nuclear genetic information for phylogenetic studies from these inexpensive and increasingly abundant datasets.},

	abstract = {Land managers must find a compromise between rapidly changing landscapes and biodiversity conservation through ecological networks. Estimating ecological networks is a key approach to enhance or maintain functional connectivity by identifying the nodes and links of a graph, which represent habitats and their corresponding functional corridors, respectively. To understand the current state of biodiversity, it is necessary to consider dynamic landscape connectivity while relying on relevant land cover maps. Although a current land cover map is relatively easy to produce using existing data, this is challenging for past landscapes. Here we investigated the impact of changes in landscape connectivity in an urban landscape at a fine scale on the habitat availability of two bird species: the tree pipit Anthus trivialis and the short-toed treecreeper Certhia brachydactyla. These species, exhibiting different niche ecologies, have shown contrasting population trends at a medium-term scale. The occurrences of C. brachydactyla were better correlated with resistance values that maximise the use of corridors, whereas the occurrences of A. trivialis better fitted with intermediate resistance values. The statistical approach indirectly highlighted relevant information about the ecology the capacity of both species to use urban habitats. Landscape connectivity increased for both species over the 24-year study period and may have implications for local abundances, which could explain, at the national scale, the increase in populations of C. brachydactyla, but not the decrease in populations of A. trivialis. Thus, more attention must be paid on rural habitats and their associated species that are more impacted by human activities, but efforts could also be achieved in urban areas especially for highly corridor-dependent species. Studying dynamic landscape connectivity at a fine scale is essential for estimating past and future land cover changes and their associated impacts on ecological networks, to better reconcile human and biodiversity concerns in land management.},

	abstract = {Background The noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) is a native European species in decline, with a contracting range and diminishing populations and abundance. Previous studies revealed this species significant genetic diversity in the south-eastern Europe, with populations from the western and the southern part of the Balkan Peninsula being the most divergent. However, sampling of populations from the western part of the Balkans was limited and insufficient for investigating genetic diversity and population divergence for the purpose of conservation planning and management. Thus, the major aim of this study was to fill in this knowledge gap by studying mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA diversity, using 413 noble crayfish from 18 populations from waterbodies in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula. Methods Phylogenetic analysis of studied populations and their mitochondrial diversity were studied using COI and 16S sequences and population genetic structure was described using 15 microsatellite loci. Results Phylogeographic analysis revealed new divergent mitochondrial haplotypes for the populations in the westernmost part of the Balkan Peninsula in the tributaries of the Sava and Drava rivers. Microsatellite data indicated that these populations harbour an important component of genetic diversity within A. astacus. The results suggest that the western part of the Balkans played an important role as microrefugia during the Pleistocene climate fluctuations, allowing the long term persistence of A. astacus populations in this region. These results will also be important to supporting conservation decision making and planning.},

	abstract = {Spreading of alien water frog species (genus Pelophylax) has been reported across Europe, posing a severe risk for the replacement or genetic swamping of indigenous species. Crna Mlaka fishponds in Central Croatia were an experimental station for freshwater fish aquaculture during the first half of twentieth century and hosted fish from different parts of Balkans. Crna Mlaka fishponds are thus estimated to be at higher risk of non-native frogs, likely introduced with the aquaculture industry, causing introgressive hybridization and genetic admixture of native Pelophylax species. We used nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences, in combination with microsatellite markers, to characterize water frogs of Crna Mlaka. We detected alleles of two native species, the Eurasian marsh frog Pelophylax ridibundus (Pallas, 1771) and the pool frog Pelophylax lessonae (Camerano, 1882), as well as non-native Albanian pool frog Pelophylax shqipericus (Hotz, Uzzell, Gunther, Tunner et Heppich, 1987) and Balkan pool frog Pelophylax kurtmuelleri (Gayda, 1940). Moreover, we found five hybrid forms: P. kurtmuelleri × P. ridibundus, P. kurtmuelleri × P. shqipericus, P. lessonae × P. kurtmuelleri, P. ridibundus × P. shqipericus, and P. lessonae × P. shqipericus indicating the existence of a hybrid swarm. The last three hybrids have never been reported in natural populations. Interestingly, although expected, no P. kl. esculentus (P. ridibundus × P. lessonae) was detected. Additionally, water frogs with introgressed mtDNA were detected, which results in cyto-nuclear discordance. The results of this study suggest that this is a unique case of species melting pot, a hybrid swarm emerging from two alien and two native frog species resulting in more than 50 % of water frogs at this location being hybrids and/or having introgressed mtDNA and the loss of the hybridogenetic reproductive system of Pelophylax kl. esculentus.},

	abstract = {Ornamental trade has become an important introduction pathway of non-native aquatic species worldwide. Correspondingly, there has been an alarming increase in the number of established crayfish of aquarium origin in Europe over the previous decade. The oomycete Aphanomyces astaci, the pathogen causing crayfish plague responsible for serious declines of European crayfish populations, is dispersed with introduced North American crayfish. The role of ornamental taxa in introducing and spreading different genotypes of this pathogen in open waters remains unclear. We investigated the distribution, prevalence, and diversity of A. astaci in Budapest, Hungary, which became a hotspot of aquarium crayfish introductions. Their establishment in this area was facilitated by locally abundant thermal waters. We screened for A. astaci in six host taxa from 18 sites sampled between 2018 and 2021: five cambarids (Cambarellus patzcuarensis, Faxonius limosus, Procambarus alleni, P. clarkii, P. virginalis) and one native astacid (Pontastacus leptodactylus). The pathogen was confirmed at five sampled sites in four host taxa: P. virginalis, P. clarkii, F. limosus, and for the first time in European open waters also in P. alleni. Genotyping was successful only in individuals from two different brooks where multiple host species coexisted but revealed unexpected patterns. Mitochondrial B-haplogroup of A. astaci, previously usually reported from Pacifastacus leniusculus or infected European species, was detected in P. virginalis at both sites, and in both F. limosus and P. virginalis sampled from a thermally stable tributary of Barát brook in 2018. In contrast, A-haplogroup of A. astaci was detected in coexisting F. limosus, P. virginalis and P. clarkii sampled in the same watercourse just a few hundred meters downstream in 2020. Additional genotyping methods indicated that a previously unknown A. astaci strain was associated with the latter haplogroup. One P. virginalis individual from 2020 was apparently co-infected by strains representing both mitochondrial haplogroups. The results indicated multiple sources of A. astaci in Budapest, likely directly associated with the introduction of ornamental species, interspecific transmission of this pathogen among ornamental hosts, and potential for a quick spatial or temporal turnover of dominant A. astaci strains at a certain locality. This highlights that in regions with high richness of potential A. astaci hosts, host taxon/pathogen genotype combinations become unpredictable, which might prevent reliable genotyping of pathogen sources in local crayfish mass mortalities.},

	abstract = {Numerous native European freshwater crayfish populations are in decline due to the lethal disease crayfish plague caused by the pathogen Aphanomyces astaci (Oomycetes). Presence of this pathogen has already been recorded in the Plitvice Lakes National Park (NP), Croatia, where two protected native crayfish species, the noble crayfish Astacus astacus and the stone crayfish Austropotamobius torrentium occur. Data presented in this manuscript are part of a two-year monitoring project of the pathogen in the NP. Previously, we have reported the overall prevalence of A. astaci positive individuals in A. astacus and A. torrentium populations (14 % and 2 % of tested crayfish, respectively) within the NP. Here, we report the detailed distribution of the pathogen within the NP and differences in its prevalence in populations of both crayfish species collected at different locations within the NP. Moreover, we have identified the A. astaci genotype present within the NP and discuss our findings in the context of crayfish plague related management activities in the NP. The majority of pathogen records were from the A. astacus populations which were all in close proximity, and this presumably facilitated the pathogen spread among them. Prevalence of A. astaci positive A. astacus varied in different populations from 10 % to 18 %. In comparison, only one out of three tested A. torrentium populations, in the proximity of the A. astacus populations, was A. astaci positive (prevalence 17 %), while in the other two geographically distant populations pathogen was not recorded. The microsatellite genotyping identified the presence of A. astaci haplogroup A (As genotype). Although known for its low virulence, A. astaci of haplogroup A could still cause mass mortalities, especially if combined with other stressors that can impair crayfish health. Obtained results were used as a baseline for the development of monitoring protocol for A. astaci and were incorporated in the management plan for protection of vulnerable native species in the NP. We present the proposed management activities for prevention of unintentional spread of the crayfish plague pathogen to adjacent streams that are inhabited by pathogen free native crayfish populations},

The relative Wolbachia infection intensity within individuals was determined using quantitative real-time PCR and was significantly higher in the B-supergroup than in the A-supergroup. Experimental results of temperature effect on bacterial density in each developmental stage revealed a significant decrease in Wolbachia infection intensity following exposure to high temperature (37°C) in both sexes and implied that Wolbachia might survive in room temperature (25°C) better than in high temperature. Experimental results of crowding effects on Wolbachia infection intensity suggested a negative correlation between copepod nauplii and Wolbachia infection intensity. No effect of rearing temperature on the sex ratio was reported although the fecundity was significantly decreased by high temperature. The results showed that Wolbachia infection intensity to be correlated with crowding conditions and was decreased following exposure of elevated temperature.},

One of these, Anablepsoides cryptocallus, also known as ‘Poisson gale’, is the only endemic freshwater fish of Martinique and a species with a poorly understood distribution range. In this study, an environmental DNA (eDNA) detection protocol was developed, validated, and optimized, targeting a short fragment (125 bp) of the A. cryptocallus COI mitochondrial gene, to investigate the presence of this species in Martinique. Fifty-seven sites spread over 43 permanent rivers and two wetlands were sampled using both eDNA and conventional fishing (dip net capture). Presence was confirmed in 27 sites using eDNA detection, and in nine sites by dip net fishing. eDNA-based detection of A. cryptocallus was effective and less time-consuming than conventional fishing, making it a relevant tool for future studies throughout the island. Even though A. cryptocallus was found to be present in a significant number of sites, many sites previously known for this species were found to be negative, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring. There is now an urgent need to propose protection status for this endemic species to preserve its preferential habitats, as these are being increasingly threatened by human activities that are leading to habitat loss and fragmentation.},

So far, no endemic South American species of terrestrial isopods have been investigated for Wolbachia infection. In this work, populations from two species of Balloniscus (B. sellowii and B. glaber) were studied through a diagnostic PCR assay. Fifteen new Wolbachia 16S rDNA sequences were detected. Wolbachia found in both species were generally specific to one population, and five populations hosted two different Wolbachia 16S rDNA sequences. Prevalence was higher in B. glaber than in B. sellowii, but uninfected populations could be found in both species. Wolbachia strains from B. sellowii had a higher genetic variation than those isolated from B. glaber. AMOVA analyses showed that most of the genetic variance was distributed among populations of each species rather than between species, and the phylogenetic analysis suggested that Wolbachia strains from Balloniscus cluster within Supergroup B, but do not form a single monophyletic clade, suggesting multiple infections for this group. Our results highlight the importance of studying Wolbachia prevalence and genetic diversity in Neotropical species and suggest that South American arthropods may harbor a great number of diverse strains, providing an interesting model to investigate the evolution of Wolbachia and its hosts.},

	abstract = {In the last decades, dispersal studies have benefited from the use of molecular markers for detecting patterns differing between categories of individuals and have highlighted sex-biased dispersal in several species. To explain this phenomenon, several hypotheses implying mating systems, intrasexual competition or sex-related handicaps have been proposed. In this context, we investigated sex-biased dispersal in Armadillidium vulgare, a terrestrial isopod with a promiscuous mating system. As a proxy for effective dispersal, we performed a fine-scale investigation of the spatial genetic structure in males and females, using individuals originating from five sampling points located within 70 m of each other. Based on microsatellite markers and spatial autocorrelation analyses, our results revealed that while males did not present a significant genetic structure at this geographic scale, females were significantly and genetically more similar to each other when they were collected in the same sampling point. As females invest more parental care than males in A. vulgare, but also because this species is promiscuous and males experience a high intrasexual competition, our results meet the predictions of most classical hypotheses for sex-biased dispersal. We suggest that widening dispersal studies to other isopods or crustaceans, differing in their ecology or mating system and displaying varying levels of parental care, might shed light on the processes underlying the evolution of sex-biased dispersal.},

	abstract = {Female multiple mating has been extensively studied to understand how nonobvious benefits, generally thought to be of genetic nature, could overcome heavy costs such as an increased risk of infection during mating. However, the impact of infection itself on multiple mating has rarely been addressed. The interaction between the bacterium Wolbachia and its terrestrial crustacean host, Armadillidium vulgare, is a relevant model to investigate this question. In this association, Wolbachia is able to turn genetic males into functional females (i.e. feminization), thereby distorting the sex ratio and decreasing the number of available males at the population scale. Moreover, in A. vulgare, females have been shown to mate multiply under laboratory conditions and males prefer uninfected females over infected ones. Additionally, different Wolbachia strains are known to infect A. vulgare and these strains differ in their transmission rate and virulence. All these elements suggest a potential impact of different Wolbachia strains on multiple mating. To investigate this assumption, we collected gravid females in a wild A. vulgare population harbouring both uninfected females and females infected with one of two different Wolbachia strains (wVulM and wVulC) and performed paternity analyses on the obtained broods using microsatellite markers. We demonstrate that (i) multiple paternity is common in this wild population of A. vulgare, with a mean number of fathers of 4.48 ± 1.24 per brood and (ii) females infected with wVulC produced broods with a lower multiple paternity level compared with females infected with wVulM and uninfected ones. This work improves our knowledge of the impact of infections on reproductive strategies.},

	abstract = {Crayfish are of major ecological importance within freshwater ecosystems, due to their central position in the trophic niche, acting as regulators of food webs. However, the introduction of exotic crayfish species threatens native species. Indeed, these introduced crayfish often outcompete local species and can even disseminate pathogens (i.e. exotic American species with the crayfish plague, Aphanomyces astaci Schikora, 1906), leading to rapid population losses. We report here the first record of rusty crayfish Faxonius rusticus in the wild in France and in Europe so far. The situation is alarming because F. rusticus is native to North America, potentially carrier of A. astaci, and classified among the most invasive species of crayfish in the world, due to its impressive dispersal capacities. This study reports high densities of individuals from a pond along the Inières Brook, where all size classes are represented, both adults and juveniles. A total of thirty-seven specimens were also observed over 2.5 km of the Inières brook as well as the Briane (main stream) in 2019 where this species co-occurs with another invasive crayfish species, the signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus. In these sites, all specimens of both species were positive for crayfish plague presence with some individuals showing high level of infection (A5) (on an A0 to A7 scale), rarely observed in specimen of other invasive crayfish species. Since these first observations, the situation seems to have worsened, with 847 individuals captured, in the pond along the Inières brook, during survey sessions in 2021.},

	abstract = {In the isopod Armadillidium vulgare, many females produce progenies with female-biased sex ratios, owing to two feminizing sex ratio distorters (SRD): Wolbachia endosymbionts and the f element. We investigated the distribution and population dynamics of these SRD and mitochondrial DNA variation in 16 populations from Europe and Japan. Confirming and extending results from the 1990s, we found that the SRD are present at variable frequencies in populations and that the f element is overall more frequent than Wolbachia. The two SRD never co-occur at high frequency in any population, suggesting an apparent mutual exclusion. We also detected Wolbachia or the f element in some males, which probably reflects insufficient titer to induce feminization or presence of masculinizing alleles. Our results are consistent with a single integration event of a Wolbachia genome in the A. vulgare genome at the origin of the f element, which contradicts an earlier hypothesis of frequent losses and gains. We identified strong linkage between Wolbachia strains and mitochondrial haplotypes, but no association between the f element and mitochondrial background. Our results open new perspectives on SRD evolutionary dynamics in A. vulgare, the evolution of genetic conflicts and their impact on the variability of sex determination systems.},

	abstract = {The stone crayfish Austropotamobius torrentium is globally endangered due to anthropogenic pressure on its habitats, climate change and the invasive crayfish species, particularly the signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus. Aiming to guide A. torrentium conservation within the hotspot of its genetic diversity in the western Balkan Peninsula, we combined population genetics and species distribution models (SDMs) to reveal the impact of climate change and the invasive P. leniusculus on A. torrentium diversity. Population genetic analyses based on newly developed microsatellites revealed moderate within-population genetic diversity and high differentiation among populations, reflecting isolated populations with limited gene flow. Alongside strong genetic structuring, we discovered high level of inbreeding coefficient indicating homozygote excess within the majority of populations. The SDMs results predicted substantial reductions of suitable habitats for A. torrentium by 2070; 80 % of its currently suitable habitat is predicted to be lost under high‐warming climate change scenario. Obtained results indicated that 44 % of populations with high and/or unique genetic diversity, including three highly divergent and geographically restricted evolutionary lineages, are located in the areas predicted to become unsuitable in the future, highlighting their vulnerability to extinction. Further, SDMs revealed considerable decrease of future habitat suitability for P. leniusculus, suggesting that climate change represents greater threat to A. torrentium. Our study highlights the importance of conserving remnant A. torrentium populations, among other, through assisted migration and population mixing that could help populations overcome the risks of inbreeding and maladaptation, and thus enabling A. torrentium to withstand the ongoing climate change.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the trophic niche of non-native species is a valuable way to measure both their invasion success and putative impacts on recipient food webs. Theory predicts that successful invasive species display flexible diet depending on environment conditions, have large trophic niche, and can overlap the trophic niche of functionally similar native species. We investigated these predictions using the redclaw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) as an invasive species model and omnivorous and detritivorous shrimps as native competitors in recently invaded insular Martinican streams (Caribbean region). Although the redclaw crayfish is globally widespread, little is known about its trophic ecology and potential impacts on other crustaceans in its non-native regions. Using stable isotope analyses to quantify the trophic ecology of redclaw crayfish, we found that it occupied a central position in the food webs, with a primary consumer tendency at the population level. Evidence for ontogenetic shifts was found with different trajectories across streams, highlighting its trophic flexibility to environmental conditions. However, redclaw fed on a limited range of resources (small niche sizes) probably due to the local context, characterised by simplified food webs. Crayfish and shrimps shared partly similar food resources (20.5 ± 9.7 % of niche overlap with omnivorous shrimps and 14.9 ± 13.8 % with detritivorous shrimps). Finally, a slight shift in trophic niche (without niche constriction) of native crustaceans (mainly omnivorous shrimps) was observed when cooccurring with crayfish. Stable isotope analysis revealed here no evidence of striking impact of the newly introduced crayfish on the trophic ecology of native shrimps, but we call for further investigations to assess potential longer-term repercussions on native communities.},

	abstract = {The crayfish plague pathogen Aphanomyces astaci has been implicated in a number of mass mortalities and irreversible population declines of native crayfish across Europe. At present, the reservoirs of the pathogen in Europe are mainly populations of invasive North American crayfish species. In southwestern Europe, including France, a particularly widespread invader is the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii. Recent distribution data confirm that P. clarkii is present in at least 75 French departments, i.e. more than 78 % of those in metropolitan France. We analysed the prevalence and pathogen load of A. astaci in 42 populations of this species in western France (Nouvelle Aquitaine region), where the species is most densely distributed, particularly in a wide range of environments around the Gironde estuary. The pathogen was detected by two different quantitative PCR assays in more than three quarters of the populations studied (34 out of 42); 163 out of 480 analysed crayfish individuals tested positive for the presence of A. astaci. In most cases, individual infection levels were very low, detectable with quantitative PCR but not sufficient for pathogen genotyping. In seven P. clarkii individuals from four populations, however, we were able to assess A. astaci variation by microsatellite markers and sequencing of mitochondrial markers. All these host specimens carried A. astaci genotype group D, haplotype d1, which has caused the majority of crayfish plague outbreaks in neighbouring Spain. In contrast, the French outbreaks genotyped to date (including eight newly analysed in this study) were mostly caused by strains of genotype group B, specific to the signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus. Haplotype d1 found in P. clarkii was involved in one of the newly characterised outbreaks. Our study confirms that P. clarkii is a potentially important reservoir of the crayfish plague pathogen in France, but not the main source of the pathogen in mass mortalities of A. pallipes, probably due to different ecological requirements of the different invasive host crayfish. However, as P. clarkii continues to spread, the threat posed by this species to native crayfish is likely to increase.},

In contrast, there were none conducted in Africa. The relatively large number of published studies has led to an interesting diversity of protocols designed or utilized, with most favouring the development of their own assays (69.33 %). That said, filtration (as an eDNA capture method) was common (80.5 %), along with the use of commercially available eDNA extraction kits (69.8 %). The COI gene also appeared to be the preferred target region (89.33 %). Such range of protocols is interesting, but is it optimal? Are the best protocols always being utilized?

	abstract = {The pace of biological invasions has increased in recent decades, leading to multiple invasions and the potential dominance of invasive species, destabilizing local ecological networks. This provides opportunities to study new ecological species interactions, including predation. Tropical freshwaters have been particularly concerned by aquatic invasions and we focused here on the Martinique island (Lesser Antilles). We examined the predator–prey relationships involving invasive Thiarid snails (Tarebia granifera and Melanoides tuberculata) and the native Neritina punctulata, both confronted with a newcomer predator, the redclaw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus). We conducted several mesocosm experiments to assess the impact of crayfish predation on snail survival and the passive and active antipredator responses of snails. A first experiment indicated snail survival rates between 50 % and 80 %, depending on crayfish size and sex. Notably, there was a negative correlation between snail survival and male crayfish size and the predation method (shell crushing vs. “body sucking”) varied with crayfish size. The second experiment suggested no refuge size for snails, with both very small ({ textless}5 mm) and very large ({ textgreater}5 mm) unable to escape predation, regardless of crayfish size (from 77 to 138 mm) or sex. Finally, we investigated the escape behavior of Thiarids regarding three crayfish cues. Melanoides tuberculata tend to bury in the substrate and T. granifera to climb up aquarium walls, what was expected from their shell morphologies, and both responding to crayfish cues within minutes. Overall, C. quadricarinatus proves to be an efficient snail predator with limited escape options for snails, potentially contributing to the decline of certain snail populations in Martinique. This omnivorous predator might impact other native species across different groups, including shrimps and fish. Our study underscores the urgent need for monitoring efforts, solidifying the redclaw crayfish reputation as a dangerous invasive species for freshwater macrobenthic faunas worldwide.},

	abstract = {The land cover data presented here is a reconstruction of the past landscape (1993) at Very High Resolution (VHR) for the city of Poitiers, France. This reconstruction is based on multiple sources of images and data. We combined the strengths of both mono-temporal and multi-temporal classifications. Orthophotos were created at a spatial resolution of 0.5 m using aerial raw images from the French National Geographic Institute (IGN), taken during two aerial missions in July and August 1993. These orthophotos were merged at a spatial resolution of 5 m to conduct a first object-based classification using Landsat-5 TM images. The goal was to identify croplands, grasslands, coniferous and deciduous forests, urban areas, water bodies, and shadows. This learning-based classification employed a dataset consisting of 1371 polygons and demonstrated strong classification performances, achieving an overall accuracy of 86.31 % and a kappa index of 0.832. On the other hand, mono-temporal classifications at a 0.5 m spatial resolution were carried out on each orthophoto to extract trees and herbaceous vegetation, especially in urban contexts. As mono-temporal classifications contained less information, we used a larger number of polygons for the learning step: 3849 and 5173 polygons for the northern and southern classifications, respectively. The segmentation step performed better in urban areas compared to rural areas. Consequently, the performance of classifications was evaluated separately for both contexts. Urban areas exhibited excellent performances, achieving kappa indices of 0.897 and 0.881 for the northern and southern classifications, respectively, whereas only tree vegetation was accurately detected in rural areas. To compensate for the lack of information such as buildings, railways, or roads, we modified the BD TopoⓇ dataset from IGN. This land cover map provides highly detailed information, facilitating the understanding of urban sprawl and changes in urban and rural vegetation surrounding the city of Poitiers. Due to these reasons, this freely accessible map can be utilized by researchers, land managers, and private companies for addressing urban and ecological challenges.},

	abstract = {The Lesser Antilles, in the Eastern Caribbean, were long considered to have only two species in the genus Iguana Laurenti 1768: the Lesser Antillean iguana Iguana delicatissima, which is endemic to parts of the Lesser Antilles, and the common green iguana Iguana iguana, which also occurs throughout Central and South America. However, herpetologists and reptile collectors have pointed out strong physical differences between some of the island populations of Iguana iguana and those from the continent. Drawing on both morphological and genetic data, this paper describes a third species Iguana insularis sp. nov. from the southern Lesser Antilles, specifically the countries of Saint Lucia, St Vincent &amp; the Grenadines, and Grenada. The new species is described based on the following unique combination of characters: Presence of high median and medium to small lateral horns on the snout; Small subtympanic plate not exceeding 20 % of the eardrum size; Two or three scales of decreasing size anterior to the subtympanic plate; Fewer than ten small to medium triangular gular spikes; Medium sized dewlap; Low number of small to medium dispersed nuchal tubercles; Dark brown iris, with the white of the eye visible; Oval, prominent nostril; Short and relatively flat head; High dorsal spines; No swelling of the jowls in reproductively active males; Colour of head, body and tail changing from green to pale grey or creamy white in old adults; Vertical black stripes on body and tail, fading with age in some populations. This paper furthermore distinguishes two subspecies: Iguana insularis insularis from the Grenada Bank (comprising Grenada and the Grenadine islands), and Iguana insularis sanctaluciae from Saint Lucia. The form on the island of Saint Vincent has not been identified. Both subspecies are globally threatened by unsustainable hunting (including the pet trade) and by invasive alien species, including hybridization from invasive iguanas from South and Central America (I. iguana and I. rhinolopha, considered here as full species) that have become established in all three countries. The authors call for stronger measures to conserve the remaining purebred Iguana insularis sp. nov. throughout its range and for further research to identify other cryptic species and subspecies of Iguana in the Lesser Antilles.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity Conservation and Habitat Management is a component of Encyclopedia of Natural Resources Policy and Management in the global Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems (EOLSS), which is an integrated compendium of twenty one Encyclopedias. Biodiversity is declining worldwide at a very unprecedented rate as a complex response to several human-induced changes in the global environment. The magnitude of these changes is so large and their effects are so strongly linked to the altered ecosystem processes and to human (ab-)use of natural resources that biodiversity loss is today perceived as one of the most important issues that humankind should face with extreme urgency. Disseminating information, raising awareness, and propelling concern within a diversified target audience (general public, schools, local authorities, and government agencies) are also essential to develop shared responsibility and to encourage collaborative efforts and compliance. This has been the main objective of “Biodiversity Conservation and Habitat Management”. The Theme on Biodiversity Conservation and Habitat Management provides the essential aspects and a myriad of issues of great relevance to our world in eight major topics of discussion, and is focused on 1) History and Overview of Biodiversity Conservation and Protected Areas, 2) Management of Forests and other Wooded Habitats, 3) Management of Savannahs and Other Open Habitats, 4) Management of Wetlands, 5) Management of Tourism and Human Recreation Pressure, 6) Conservation Strategies, Species Action Plans and Translocation, 7) Captive Breeding and Gene Banks, and 8) Eradication and Control of Invasive Species. These two volumes are aimed at the following five major target audiences: University and College students Educators, Professional practitioners, Research personnel and Policy analysts, managers, and decision makers and NGOs.},

	abstract = {Minnows of the genus Phoxinus are common and an often highly abundant fish species in Palearctic freshwater habitats. Phoxinus species have a complex evolutionary history, phylogenetic relationships are not well understood and there are a number of unresolved taxonomic problems. There are currently 23 different mitochondrial genetic lineages identified in the genus Phoxinus, 13 of which are recognized as valid species. The taxonomic status of these lineages requires resolution, including the degree to which they can interbreed. Suitable nuclear molecular markers for studies of population divergence and interbreeding between morphotypes and mitochondrial lineages are lacking for Phoxinus species. Therefore, the authors developed a set of microsatellite markers using genomic information from Phoxinus lumaireul and tested their suitability for this and two related species, Phoxinus krkae and Phoxinus marsilii. Out of 16 microsatellite candidate loci isolated, 12 were found to be in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium when tested on two P. lumaireul senso lato populations. Seven loci amplified across the three species, enabling the study of intraspecific genetic diversity and population structure within P. marsilii and P. krkae. The markers were able to clearly resolve differences among the three tested species, including the recently described P. krkae, and are therefore suitable for the detection of introgression and hybridization among populations consisting of mixtures of two or more of P. lumaireul s. l., P. marsilii and P. krkae.},

The yabby is also the principal commercial freshwater crustacean species in Australia subject to explotation via inland fisheries and aquaculture. To address the genomics knowledge gap for this species and explore cost effective and efficient methods for genome assembly, we generated 106.8 gb of Nanopore reads and performed a long-read only assembly of the Cherax destructor genome. On a mini-server configured with an ultra-fast swap space, the de novo assembly took 131 hours ({ textasciitilde}5.5 days). Genome polishing with 126.3 gb of PCR-Free Illumina reads generated an assembled genome size of 3.3 gb (74.6 % BUSCO completeness) with a contig N50 of 80,900 bp, making it the most contiguous for freshwater crayfish genome assemblies. We found an unusually large number of cellulase genes within the yabby genome which is relevant to understanding the nutritional biology, commercial feed development and ecological role of this species and crayfish more generally. These resources will be useful for genomic research on freshwater crayfish and our methods for rapid and super-efficient genome assembly will have wide application.},

Its former description is completed by the use of 38 new samples for genetic and morphological analysis. Seventeen microsatellites were used to estimate genetic diversity, population structure and the level of introgression with other Iguana species over nearly the whole range of the species. ND4 and PAC sequences were also used to better characterize hybridization and to complete the description of this lineage. The I. insularis population of St. Vincent shows a high level of introgression from I. iguana whereas in the Grenadines, most islands present pure insularis populations but several show evidence of introgressions. Of the two remaining populations of I. insularis sanctaluciae, only one is still purebred. The recent identification of this and other distinct insular species and subspecies in the eastern Caribbean, and evaluation of where hybridization has occurred, are timely and important because the native iguanas are in urgent need of conservation action. Among the greatest threats is the ongoing human-mediated spread of invasive iguanas from Central and South America, which are destroying the endemic insular lineages through multiple diachronic introgression events.},

	abstract = {In the terrestrial isopod Armadillidium vulgare, many females produce progenies with female-biased sex ratios due to two feminizing sex ratio distorters (SRD): Wolbachia endosymbionts and a nuclear non-mendelian locus called the f element. To investigate the potential impact of these SRD on the evolution of host sex determination, we analyzed their temporal distribution in six A. vulgare populations sampled between 2003 and 2017, for a total of 29 time points. SRD distribution was heterogeneous among populations despite their close geographic locations, so that when one SRD was frequent in a population, the other SRD was rare. In contrast with spatial heterogeneity, our results overall did not reveal substantial temporal variability in SRD prevalence within populations, suggesting equilibria in SRD evolutionary dynamics may have been reached or nearly so. Temporal stability was also generally reflected in mitochondrial and nuclear variation. Nevertheless, in a population, a Wolbachia strain replacement coincided with changes in mitochondrial composition but no change in nuclear composition, thus constituting a typical example of mitochondrial sweep caused by endosymbiont rise in frequency. Rare incongruence between Wolbachia strains and mitochondrial haplotypes suggested the occurrence of intraspecific horizontal transmission, making it a biologically relevant parameter for Wolbachia evolutionary dynamics in A. vulgare. Overall, our results provide an empirical basis for future studies on SRD evolutionary dynamics in the context of multiple sex determination factors co-existing within a single species, to ultimately evaluate the impact of SRD on the evolution of host sex determination mechanisms and sex chromosomes.},

	abstract = {While pesticides are essential for food production, their widespread use poses environmental risks beyond lowland areas. Recent evidence indicates that mountain ecosystems are also vulnerable due to both local agriculture and long-range atmospheric transport. This study assesses pesticide contamination and ecological risks in five mountainous agricultural watersheds of north-central Chile, where pesticides support intensive crop production. Using primarily polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS), complemented by sediment samples, we found pesticides at 26 of 30 sampled sites. Detection varied by location and method. Desethylatrazine, an atrazine metabolite, was most frequently found in POCIS samples, detected at 20 sites across all watersheds. While other pesticides only occurred at few sites, their presence across multiple, geographically dispersed locations contributed to extensive ecological risk. Northern watersheds (Limarí, Choapa, Aconcagua) showed the highest ecological risks, despite lower pesticide loads, due to the presence of highly toxic insecticides. Key factors influencing pesticide distribution included water conductivity, agricultural land use, and latitude. Ecotoxicological risk assessments revealed eight pesticides exceeding high-risk thresholds for aquatic organisms—mainly insecticides and fungicides. Pyrethroids such as deltamethrin, cyfluthrin, and lambda-cyhalothrin posed severe threats to fish and invertebrates. High-risk levels were also detected in sediments, particularly in the northernmost Limarí watershed. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted monitoring and stricter pesticide regulation in mountain freshwater ecosystems of Chile, which are vital water sources and harbor unique biodiversity. This study provides one of the first comprehensive evaluations of pesticide risks in mountainous rivers, highlighting the ecological threats from agricultural contaminants.},

Despite limits (taxonomic resolution nor taxa quantification), the method has repeatedly proved its effectiveness and is now used as routine freshwater monitoring tool. Especially since traditional method, including electrofishing (TEF), are reputed stressful for the species, non-selective and disruptive for the ecosystem, leading to its abandonment in Martinique (F.W.I.) for regular monitoring. The aim of this project was to explore the possibility of using eDNA metabarcoding for the detection of fish and decapods in Martinique streams, by first validating it with TEF. We selected 14 stations, a representative panel of the river diversity, and performed TEF and eDNA to compare both, based on the species richness recovered. Then, from eDNA taxonomic inventories, we assessed the ecological state of the studied stations, using different biodiversity indices (Shannon, Simpson and Bray-Curtis) and investigated how stations abiotic characteristics shape assemblages. Here, we confirmed the eDNA metabarcoding method as a reliable tool for monitoring fish and decapods, confirming most of the taxa caught by TEF and revealing the presence of additional (native and/or invasive) species. We faced some issues in discriminating some genetically close species (e.g. Sicydium sp.) potentially leading to under-representation in community assemblages, but not in functional diversity. Additional efforts are needed to raise standardized protocols, but we encourage stakeholders to join such initiative to shed light on the rich biodiversity in sometimes poorly studied regions and to face invasions.},

	abstract = {Freshwater wetlands are among the world's most valuable ecosystems, supporting diverse biota and critical ecological services, yet these habitats have suffered extensive and pervasive anthropogenic disturbance. Northern Australia represents a rare example of a relatively unmodified, vast wetland habitat. The freshwater crayfishes of the region are poorly documented, with one enigmatic species, the nutcracker yabby Cherax nucifraga, described from a single individual sampled opportunistically from the stomach of a predatory fish. Here we report on the rediscovery of C. nucifraga from a relatively limited distribution in semi-permanent coastal freshwater wetlands. Field studies were conducted to inform natural resource management and conservation. Genome skimming to recover mitogenomes, 18S–28S and histone sequences demonstrated a sister relationship with two congeners from the tropics, and moderate molecular genetic substructure was apparent within C. nucifraga between mainland and Melville Island locations. Cherax nucifraga is characterised by the presence of a strawberry-coloured soft patch on the outer margin of the claw, uniquely present in both mature males and females. Meristic and multivariate morphometric comparisons are made with the co-occurring redclaw Cherax quadricarinatus and the allopatric whiteclaw yabby Cherax bicarinatus, with a summary of diagnostic traits developed into a visual guide and key. Programs to further understand ecology, threats and traditional ecological knowledge will help to inform the future conservation management of the species in the face of increasing development and environmental change to northern Australian coastal freshwater wetlands. Specific conservation actions include identifying and protecting refuge habitats and preventing incursions by other Cherax species.},

	abstract = {La structure génétique d’une importante population d’écrevisses à pattes blanches Austropotamobius pallipes a été appréhendée avec cinq marqueurs microsatellites en échantillonnant six secteurs le long de son aire de distribution. Le niveau de polymorphisme est apparu relativement élevé avec une valeur moyenne d’hétérozygotie de 0,394 pour l’ensemble de la population. Aucune différenciation génétique n’a été révélée entre les différents sites échantillonnés, indiquant que cette population est panmictique. La possibilité d’importants flux géniques étendus le long de ce ruisseau, vers l’aval aussi bien que vers l’amont, est discutée. The genetic structure of a large population of the white-clawed crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes was assessed with five microsatellite markers by sampling six sites along its extent. The level of genetic polymorphism was relatively high with a mean heterozygosity value of 0.394 for the whole population. No genetic differentiation was observed between the different sampled sites, indicating that this population was panmictic. The possibility of extensive gene flow along this brook, downstream as well as upstream, is discussed.},
