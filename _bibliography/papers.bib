	abstract = {A nucleotide sequence analysis of a portion of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit was performed to define the phylogeography of the threatened crayfish Austropotamobius (Decapoda; Astacidae) in Italy. We collected 61 specimens from 31 localities across the Italian peninsula. For the phylogenetic inference, we combined the 61 Austropotamobius spp sequences obtained from this study with 18 sequences deposited in GenBank and corresponding to Italian, French, Irish, Swiss, and Slovenian locations. Among the analysed sequences, 34 distinct haplotypes were detected. Our results confirmed the presence of both A. pallipes and A. italicus in the Italian peninsula and the existence within the latter species of a strong intraspecific genetic variation, due to the occurrence of four subspecies with a well-defined geographic distribution. From a conservation viewpoint, Italy, with its high haplotype variability, may be considered a ‘hot spot’ for the genetic diversity of the European native crayfish Austropotamobius. We suggest that re-introduction programs should be conducted with extreme caution in Italy, since not only the two Austropotamobius species but also the four A. italicus subspecies are genetically and taxonomically separate units and require independent conservation plans.},

	abstract = {The infraorder Anomura consists of a morphologically and ecologically heterogeneous group of decapod crustaceans, and has attracted interest from taxonomists for decades attempting to find some order out of the seemingly chaotic diversity within the group. Species-level diversity within the Anomura runs the gamut from the “hairy” spindly-legged yeti crab found in deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments to the largest known terrestrial invertebrate, the robust coconut or robber crab. Owing to a well-developed capacity for parallel evolution, as evidenced by the occurrence of multiple independent carcinization events, Anomura has long tested the patience and skill of both taxonomists attempting to find order, and phylogeneticists trying to establish stable hypotheses of evolutionary inter-relationships. In this study, we performed genome skimming to recover the mitogenome sequences of 12 anomuran species including the world’s largest extant invertebrate, the robber crab (Birgus latro), thereby over doubling these resources for this group, together with 8 new brachyuran mitogenomes. Maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian-inferred (BI) phylogenetic reconstructions based on amino acid sequences from mitogenome protein-coding genes provided strong support for the monophyly of the Anomura and Brachyura and their sister relationship, consistent with previous studies. The majority of relationships within families were supported and were largely consistent with current taxonomic classifications, whereas many relationships at higher taxonomic levels were unresolved. Nevertheless, we have strong support for a polyphyletic Paguroidea and recovered a well-supported clade of a subset of paguroids (Diogenidae + Coenobitidae) basal to all other anomurans, though this requires further testing with greater taxonomic sampling. We also introduce a new feature to the MitoPhAST bioinformatics pipeline (https://github.com/mht85/MitoPhAST) that enables the extraction of mitochondrial gene order (MGO) information directly from GenBank files and clusters groups based on common MGOs. Using this tool, we compared MGOs across the Anomura and Brachyura, identifying Anomura as a taxonomic “hot spot” with high variability in MGOs among congeneric species from multiple families while noting the broad association of highly-rearranged MGOs with several anomuran lineages inhabiting extreme niches. We also demonstrate the value of MGOs as a source of novel synapomorphies for independently reinforcing tree-based relationships and for shedding light on relationships among challenging groups such as the Aegloidea and Lomisoidea that were unresolved in phylogenetic reconstructions. Overall, this study contributes a substantial amount of new genetic material for Anomura and attempts to further resolve anomuran evolutionary relationships where possible based on a combination of sequence and MGO information. The new feature in MitoPhAST adds to the relatively limited number of bioinformatics tools available for MGO analyses, which can be utilized widely across animal groups.},

	abstract = {With the advent of the Anthropocene, biological invasions have reached an unprecedented level, and the number of species introductions is still increasing in an ever-changing world. Despite major advances in invasion science, significant debate and lack of clarity remain surrounding the determinants of success of introduced species, the magnitude and dimensions of their impact, and the mechanisms sustaining successful invasions. Empirical studies show divergent impacts of alien populations on ecosystems and contrasting effects of biotic and abiotic factors on the dynamics of alien populations, which hinders the creation of a unified theory of biological invasions. Compounding these issues is the plethora of hypotheses that aim to explain invasion success, which can be unclear and contradictory. We propose a synthesis that categorizes hypotheses along a timeline of invasion. We sorted invasion hypotheses along the invasion timeline, and considered population, community and ecosystem levels. This temporal sorting of invasion concepts shows that each is relevant at a specific stage of the invasion. Although concepts and empirical findings on alien species may appear contradictory, when mapped onto an invasion timeline, they may be combined in a complementary way. An overall scheme is proposed to summarise the theoretical dynamics of ecosystems subjected to invasions. For any given case study, this framework provides a guide through the maze of theories and should help choose the appropriate concepts according to the stage of invasion.},

	abstract = {The oomycete Aphanomyces astaci is generally considered a parasite specific to freshwater crayfish, and it has become known as the crayfish plague pathogen. Old experimental work that reported transmission of crayfish plague to the Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis, and the ability of A. astaci to grow in non-decapod crustaceans, has never been tested properly. We re-evaluated the host range of A. astaci by screening for the presence of A. astaci in two crab species cohabiting with infected crayfish in fresh waters, as well as in other higher crustaceans from such localities. The animals were tested with species-specific quantitative PCR, and the pathogen determination was confirmed by sequencing of an amplified fragment of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer. Furthermore, we examined microscopically cuticle samples from presumably infected crab individuals for the presence of A. astaci-like hyphae and checked for the presence of pathogen DNA in such samples. Screenings of benthopelagic mysids, amphipods and benthic isopods did not suggest infection by A. astaci in non-decapod crustaceans. In contrast, both studied lake populations of crabs (a native semiterrestrial species Potamon potamios in Turkey, and an invasive catadromous E. sinensis in Sweden) were infected with this parasite according to both molecular and microscopic evidence. Analyses of polymorphic microsatellite loci demonstrated that A. astaci strains in the crabs and in cohabiting crayfish belonged to the same genotype group, suggesting crayfish as the source for crab infection. The potential for A. astaci transmission in the opposite direction, from crabs to crayfish, and potential impact of this pathogen on populations of freshwater crabs require further investigations, because of possible consequences for crayfish and freshwater crab conservation and aquaculture.},

This phenomenon could result in the extinction of endemic species. This study aims at investigating the hybridization dynamics between the endemic and threatened Lesser Antillean iguana (Iguana delicatissima) and the invasive common green iguana (Iguana iguana) in the Lesser Antilles, as well as assessing the impact of interspecific hybridization on the decline of I. delicatissima. 59 I. delicatissima (5 localities), 47 I. iguana (12 localities) and 27 hybrids (5 localities), who were all identified based on morphological characters, have been genotyped at 15 microsatellites markers. We also sequenced hybrids using ND4 mitochondrial loci to further investigate mitochondrial introgression. The genetic clustering of species and hybrid genetic assignment were performed using a comparative approach, through the implementation of a Discriminant Analysis of Principal Component (DAPC) based on statistics, as well as genetic clustering approaches based on the genetic models of several populations (Structure, NewHybrids and HIest), in order to get full characterization of hybridization patterns and introgression dynamics across the islands. The iguanas identified as hybrids in the wild, thanks to morphological analysis, were all genetically F1, F2, or backcrosses. A high proportion of individuals were also the result of a longer-term admixture. The absence of reproductive barriers between species leads to hybridization when species are in contact. Yet morphological and behavioral differences between species could explain why males I. iguana may dominate I. delicatissima, thus resulting in short-term species displacement and extinction by hybridization and recurrent introgression from I. iguana toward I. delicatissima. As a consequence, I. delicatissima gets eliminated through introgression, as observed in recent population history over several islands. These results have profound implications for species management of the endangered I. delicatissima and practical conservation recommendations are being discussed in the light of these findings.},

	abstract = {Aphanomyces astaci, the crayfish plague pathogen, first appeared in Europe in the mid-19th century and is still responsible for mass mortalities of native European crayfish. The spread of this parasite across the continent is especially facilitated by invasive North American crayfish species that serve as its reservoir. In France, multiple cases of native crayfish mortalities have been suggested to be connected with the presence of the signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus, which is highly abundant in the country. It shares similar habitats as the native white-clawed crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes and, when infected, the signal crayfish might therefore easily transmit the pathogen to the native species. We investigated the prevalence of A. astaci in French signal crayfish populations to evaluate the danger they represent to local populations of native crayfish. Over 500 individuals of Pacifastacus leniusculus from 45 French populations were analysed, plus several additional individuals of other non-indigenous crayfish species Orconectes limosus, O. immunis and Procambarus clarkii. Altogether, 20\% of analysed signal crayfish tested positive for Aphanomyces astaci, and the pathogen was detected in more than half of the studied populations. Local prevalence varied significantly, ranging from 0\% up to 80\%, but wide confidence intervals suggest that the number of populations infected by A. astaci may be even higher than our results show. Analysis of several individuals of other introduced species revealed infections among two of these, O. immunis and P. clarkii. Our results confirm that the widespread signal crayfish serves as a key reservoir of Aphanomyces astaci in France and therefore represents a serious danger to native crayfish species, especially the white-clawed crayfish. The prevalence in other non-indigenous crayfish should also be investigated as they likely contribute to pathogen transmission in the country.},

The clades A (including A1, A2, A3) and B are separated by a high genetic divergence (5\%).

The average of genetic divergence within the major group A and B was 2.1\% ± 1.2 and 0.9\% ± 0.6 respectively. Three clades A1, A2 and A3 correspond mainly to crayfish sampled from Austria-Switzerland, South of Balkans and Italy-Spain respectively.

So far, five genotype groups of this pathogen have been identified by applying random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis on axenic cultures. To allow genotyping of A. astaci in host tissue samples, we have developed co-dominant microsatellite markers for this pathogen, tested them on pure cultures of all genotype groups, and subsequently evaluated their use on tissues of (1) natural A. astaci carriers, i.e., North American crayfish species, and (2) A. astaci-infected indigenous European species from crayfish plague outbreaks. Out of over 200 potential loci containing simple sequence repeat (SSR) motifs identified by 454 pyrosequencing of SSR-enriched library, we tested 25 loci with highest number of repeats, and finally selected nine that allow unambiguous separation of all known RAPD-defined genotype groups of A. astaci from axenic cultures. Using these markers, we were able to characterize A. astaci strains from DNA isolates from infected crayfish tissues when crayfish had a moderate to high agent level according to quantitative PCR analyses. The results support the hypothesis that different North American crayfish hosts carry different genotype groups of the pathogen, and confirm that multiple genotype groups, including the one originally introduced to Europe in the 19th century, cause crayfish plague outbreaks in Central Europe. So far undocumented A. astaci genotype seems to have caused one of the analysed outbreaks from the Czech Republic. The newly developed culture-independent approach allowing direct genotyping of this pathogen in both axenic cultures and mixed genome samples opens new possibilities in studies of crayfish plague pathogen distribution, diversity and epidemiology.},

Four decamer primers which generated six unambiguous polymorphic bands were used to analyse crayfish from 21 populations sampled in the major part of its range. Genetic diversity within populations of A. pallipes, estimated by Shannon’s diversity index, ranged from 0 to 0.446 with a mean of 0.159. A UPGMA dendrogram constructed from pairwise ΦST values between populations, revealed three clusters corresponding to populations sampled in the southern, northwestern and eastern part of its range. AMOVA analysis revealed a high genetic structure of A. pallipes populations ΦST=0.814, with 73.11\% of the genetic variation distributed between these clusters. It suggests a historical geographical separation of these groups into three refugial areas, probably in the Rhine, Mediterranean and Atlantic basins during recent glaciations. The close genetic relationships between English and western French populations are in accordance with a natural postglacial origin of English populations from individuals having survived in an Atlantic refugium. However, the present results suggest that the Irish stock originated from a human translocation of individuals from an Atlantic refugium.},

The threatened status of this species shows the necessity to establish a suitable management to protect it. An efficient management requires an increase in our knowledge about existing populations. By using allometric relationships, we characterized the size at the onset of sexual maturity in both sexes and evaluated sexual dimorphism in this population. The size at the onset of sexual maturity appeared to be different in both sexes (20.1 mm POL in males and 18.17 mm POL in females). The sexual dimorphism, shown by the variables of claw length and abdominal width, was not closely related to the puberal moult. The growth rates of this population were very different from those shown by other European populations. Discriminant analysis was performed on the data, but it did not separate the juveniles of both sexes. This study provides fundamental results concerning the relative growth of A. pallipes which could be used to compare several French populations in the future. /// Ce travail porte sur le dimorphisme sexuel et sur la croissance allométrique d'une population française de l'écrevisse autochtone, Austropotamobius pallipes pallipes.

Le dimorphisme sexuel, montré par les variables largeur de la pince et largeur de l'abdomen, n'est pas étroitement lié à la mue de puberté. Les taux de croissance sont très différents de ceux trouvés pour d'autres populations européennes. L'analyse discriminante appliquée sur les même données n'a pas permis de séparer les juvéniles des deux sexes. Cette étude fournit des résultats fondamentaux sur la croissance relative d'A. pallipes; ils pourront être utilisés pour comparer plusieurs populations françaises.},

	abstract = {1. The white-clawed crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes has a widespread distribution in Europe, but since the last century its distribution has been severely affected by a combination of factors, particularly the disease crayfish plague, introduced by foreign crayfish species. At present A. pallipes is considered as vulnerable and endangered and measures are being taken in a number of countries to conserve it. 2. The application of genetics to conservation is of practical value particularly where restocking is being considered. This study assesses levels of genetic differentiation from an analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation by restriction fragment length polymorphism of four populations sampled on a European scale. Six different composite haplotypes were detected among sixty-four crayfish representing the four populations. mtDNA nucleon diversity values within species ranged from 0.63\% to 12.35\%. A close genetic similarity was found between British and French populations of A. pallipes. 3. Results show that mtDNA can be as a suitable diagnostic marker for measuring genetic diversity between crayfish populations and that such information is of use in planning crayfish conservation strategies.},

	abstract = {Pioneering investigations on the effects of introduced populations on community structure, ecosystem functioning and services have focused on the effects of invaders on taxonomic diversity. However, taxonomic-based diversity metrics overlook the heterogeneity of species roles within and among communities. As the homogenizing effects of biological invasions on community and ecosystem processes can be subtle, they may require the use of functional diversity indices to be properly evidenced. Starting from the listing of major functional diversity indices, alongside the presentation of their strengths and limitations, we focus on studies pertaining to the effects of invasive species on native communities and recipient ecosystems using functional diversity indices. By doing so, we reveal that functional diversity of the recipient community may strongly vary at the onset of the invasion process, while it stabilizes at intermediate and high levels of invasion. As functional changes occurring during the lag phase of an invasion have been poorly investigated, we show that it is still unknown whether there are consistent changes in functional diversity metrics that could indicate the end of the lag phase. Thus, we recommend providing information on the invasion stage under consideration when computing functional diversity metrics. For the existing literature, it is also surprising that very few studies explored the functional difference between organisms from the recipient communities and invaders of the same trophic levels, or assessed the effects of non-native organism establishment into a non-analogue versus an analogue community. By providing valuable tools for obtaining in-depth diagnostics of community structure and functioning, functional diversity indices can be applied for timely implementation of restoration plans and improved conservation strategies. To conclude, our work provides a first synthetic guide for their use in hypothesis testing in invasion biology.},

Two hypotheses have been formulated about the origin of the crayfish: from British populations or from western French populations. In order to resolve this question, nine Irish crayfish populations (a total of 124 individuals) were sampled along a south–north cline and investigated by combining two molecular markers: mtDNA and RAPDs. The mtDNA marker, analysed by RFLP on the entire molecule, showed an absence of polymorphism within and among Irish populations. The RFLP haplotype found in Irish populations was only recorded in western French populations and was different from those found in English populations. This result may be explained by a human introduction of crayfish to Ireland from western French populations. RAPD analysis showed a clinal reduction of genetic variability within Irish populations from south to north, associated with an increase in their genetic differentiation. A stepwise model of translocation from the south to the north of Ireland is proposed and discussed.},

Wolbachia induce feminization in many terrestrial isopod species, particularly in the genus Armadillidium (Crustacea, Oniscidea). The diversity of Wolbachia strains infecting Armadillidium species was examined. Results reveal that natural populations of A. vulgare contain three different Wolbachia strains (wVulC, wVulM and wVulP). The wsp gene and its 3′-adjacent region show evidence that two recombination events have occurred between two of these strains. In both cases, multiple statistical analyses suggest that a small gene fragment of a strain closely related to wVulM (minor parent) is inserted into the genome of another strain closely related to wVulC (major parent). Although multiple infections in a single individual have never been demonstrated in natural population, the existence of recombination between feminizing strains suggests that bi-infections are possible, or at least that bi-infections can be maintained sufficiently long enough to allow recombination. Recombination events increase genetic diversity of Wolbachia found in Armadillidium species and may play a role in the ability of Wolbachia strains to invade new hosts.},

This haplotype was also recorded in the Fosso di Ferfereta population (Italy). Estimates of nucleotide sequence divergence among haplotypes ranged from 0.45\% to 17.4\%. Interpopulational genetic relationships showed that Spanish populations were closely related to those of Fosso di Ferfereta with a small genetic distance (0.0003) found between them. AMOVA revealed that most of the genetic variance (71.97\%) was attributed to variation between European regions. These results are in accordance with a drastic bottleneck event during the history of the Spanish populations.

	abstract = {1. In France, the distribution of the native white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes) is restricted, fragmented and mainly located in headwater streams. To conserve this indigenous species, it is necessary to characterize its habitat preferences. 2. Seven brooks in the Deux-Sèvres Département (western France) containing wild populations of A. pallipes were studied to determine its ranges of tolerance to 19 physical and chemical water parameters. On two brooks, the Sèvre Nantaise and the Verdonnière, sites with and without A. pallipes were compared. Each site was sampled twice monthly from November 2002 to November 2004. 3. It was found that the white-clawed crayfish was able to tolerate wide ranges of values of some of the measured parameters. The Magot site harboured the largest A. pallipes population (17.5 crayfish m−2) and had dissolved oxygen concentrations as low as 4.93 mg L−1, while water temperature rose above 20°C for several consecutive days during summer and nitrate concentrations were always found to be above 30 mg L−1. These unusual findings could call into question the status of A. pallipes as a bioindicator of good water quality. 4. Principal component analyses (PCA) suggested that an increase of organic matter was a discriminant factor for the presence or absence of A. pallipes. In addition, sites with and without crayfish on the Sèvre Nantaise brook showed showed significant differences (p{\textless}0.05) in total organic carbon (TOC), and those on the Verdonnière brook in turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS).

During a controlled infection experiment with a susceptible crayfish species Astacus astacus using three A. astaci strains (representing genotype groups A, B, and E), we investigated variation in their virulence and in crayfish immune defence indicators (haemocyte density, phenoloxidase activity, and production of reactive oxygen species). Experimental crayfish were exposed to two dosages of A. astaci spores (1 and 10sporesmL−1). The intensity and timing of the immune response differed between the strains as well as between the spore concentrations. Stronger and faster change in each immune parameter was observed in crayfish infected with two more virulent strains, indicating a relationship between crayfish immune response and A. astaci virulence. Similarly, the immune response was stronger and was observed earlier for the higher spore concentration. For the first time, the virulence of a strain of the genotype group E (isolated from Orconectes limosus) was experimentally tested. Total mortality was reached after 10days for the two higher spore dosages (10 and 100sporesmL−1), and after 16days for the lowest (1sporemL−1), revealing equally high and rapid mortality as caused by the genotype group B (from Pacifastacus leniusculus).

	abstract = {The North American spiny-cheek crayfish, Orconectes limosus (Rafinesque, 1817), a widespread invader in Europe, seems to have been introduced there successfully only once. According to available literature, 90 individuals of unclear origin were released in Poland in 1890. Despite this apparent bottleneck, the species has successfully colonized various aquatic habitats and has displaced native crayfish species in many places. To test whether different European populations were likely to have come from a single source and to identify their possible origin, we analyzed the diversity of the mitochondrial gene for cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) of O. limosus individuals from Europe and from its original range in North America, including the presumed source region of European populations, the Delaware River watershed (eastern USA). Two haplotypes were found in European populations. One haplotype was widespread; the other was present in a single population. In contrast, 18 haplotypes were detected in North America. This result supports the hypothesis of a single overseas introduction of O. limosus and suggests that the high invasion success of this species was not limited by an introduction bottleneck. Two divergent clades were detected in North American O. limosus populations. One, which includes the dominant haplotype in Europe, was found in a large part of the species’ present range. The 2nd (diverging by {\textgreater}1\%) was mostly restricted to a limited area in southeastern Pennsylvania. Orconectes limosus populations in the northern part of the species’ North American range, at least some of which are nonindigenous themselves, may share the source area with European O. limosus. The endangered status of O. limosus populations in southeastern Pennsylvania and northeastern Maryland, where much of the species’ genetic diversity resides, should be considered in conservation management.},

Here, we assess population differentiation in the freshwater crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, an endangered species endemic to western Europe and provide valuable information for the conservation of French populations. 2. Analysis of five microsatellite loci in 44 populations revealed very different within population levels of genetic diversity (0.000 {\textless} H0 {\textless} 0.564). Two groups, corresponding to northern and southern French populations, showed a high degree of genetic differentiation in both allele frequencies and allele sizes. Comparison of these results with previous studies of A. pallipes strongly suggests that the divergence between northern and southern populations could have occurred during the last glaciation period of the Pleistocene from one Atlantic and one Mediterranean refuge. 3. Evidence for genetic admixture between these two lineages was revealed by correspondence analyses in southern populations, probably as the result of artificial translocations. 4. French populations appeared significantly differentiated among the different river drainages and were highly structured within rivers. The impact of population size, population bottlenecks and founder events on the population genetic differentiation are discussed. 5. Based on these results, we propose the designation of two evolutionarily significant units for A. pallipes in France. Our data also support the maintenance of separate demographic management strategies for crayfish inhabiting different river systems. However, genetic analyses will have to be combined with demographic and ecological data for sustainable conservation programmes.},
