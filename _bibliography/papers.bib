	abstract = {A nucleotide sequence analysis of a portion of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit was performed to define the phylogeography of the threatened crayfish Austropotamobius (Decapoda; Astacidae) in Italy. We collected 61 specimens from 31 localities across the Italian peninsula. For the phylogenetic inference, we combined the 61 Austropotamobius spp sequences obtained from this study with 18 sequences deposited in GenBank and corresponding to Italian, French, Irish, Swiss, and Slovenian locations. Among the analysed sequences, 34 distinct haplotypes were detected. Our results confirmed the presence of both A. pallipes and A. italicus in the Italian peninsula and the existence within the latter species of a strong intraspecific genetic variation, due to the occurrence of four subspecies with a well-defined geographic distribution. From a conservation viewpoint, Italy, with its high haplotype variability, may be considered a ‘hot spot’ for the genetic diversity of the European native crayfish Austropotamobius. We suggest that re-introduction programs should be conducted with extreme caution in Italy, since not only the two Austropotamobius species but also the four A. italicus subspecies are genetically and taxonomically separate units and require independent conservation plans.},

	abstract = {The infraorder Anomura consists of a morphologically and ecologically heterogeneous group of decapod crustaceans, and has attracted interest from taxonomists for decades attempting to find some order out of the seemingly chaotic diversity within the group. Species-level diversity within the Anomura runs the gamut from the “hairy” spindly-legged yeti crab found in deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments to the largest known terrestrial invertebrate, the robust coconut or robber crab. Owing to a well-developed capacity for parallel evolution, as evidenced by the occurrence of multiple independent carcinization events, Anomura has long tested the patience and skill of both taxonomists attempting to find order, and phylogeneticists trying to establish stable hypotheses of evolutionary inter-relationships. In this study, we performed genome skimming to recover the mitogenome sequences of 12 anomuran species including the world’s largest extant invertebrate, the robber crab (Birgus latro), thereby over doubling these resources for this group, together with 8 new brachyuran mitogenomes. Maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian-inferred (BI) phylogenetic reconstructions based on amino acid sequences from mitogenome protein-coding genes provided strong support for the monophyly of the Anomura and Brachyura and their sister relationship, consistent with previous studies. The majority of relationships within families were supported and were largely consistent with current taxonomic classifications, whereas many relationships at higher taxonomic levels were unresolved. Nevertheless, we have strong support for a polyphyletic Paguroidea and recovered a well-supported clade of a subset of paguroids (Diogenidae + Coenobitidae) basal to all other anomurans, though this requires further testing with greater taxonomic sampling. We also introduce a new feature to the MitoPhAST bioinformatics pipeline (https://github.com/mht85/MitoPhAST) that enables the extraction of mitochondrial gene order (MGO) information directly from GenBank files and clusters groups based on common MGOs. Using this tool, we compared MGOs across the Anomura and Brachyura, identifying Anomura as a taxonomic “hot spot” with high variability in MGOs among congeneric species from multiple families while noting the broad association of highly-rearranged MGOs with several anomuran lineages inhabiting extreme niches. We also demonstrate the value of MGOs as a source of novel synapomorphies for independently reinforcing tree-based relationships and for shedding light on relationships among challenging groups such as the Aegloidea and Lomisoidea that were unresolved in phylogenetic reconstructions. Overall, this study contributes a substantial amount of new genetic material for Anomura and attempts to further resolve anomuran evolutionary relationships where possible based on a combination of sequence and MGO information. The new feature in MitoPhAST adds to the relatively limited number of bioinformatics tools available for MGO analyses, which can be utilized widely across animal groups.},

	abstract = {With the advent of the Anthropocene, biological invasions have reached an unprecedented level, and the number of species introductions is still increasing in an ever-changing world. Despite major advances in invasion science, significant debate and lack of clarity remain surrounding the determinants of success of introduced species, the magnitude and dimensions of their impact, and the mechanisms sustaining successful invasions. Empirical studies show divergent impacts of alien populations on ecosystems and contrasting effects of biotic and abiotic factors on the dynamics of alien populations, which hinders the creation of a unified theory of biological invasions. Compounding these issues is the plethora of hypotheses that aim to explain invasion success, which can be unclear and contradictory. We propose a synthesis that categorizes hypotheses along a timeline of invasion. We sorted invasion hypotheses along the invasion timeline, and considered population, community and ecosystem levels. This temporal sorting of invasion concepts shows that each is relevant at a specific stage of the invasion. Although concepts and empirical findings on alien species may appear contradictory, when mapped onto an invasion timeline, they may be combined in a complementary way. An overall scheme is proposed to summarise the theoretical dynamics of ecosystems subjected to invasions. For any given case study, this framework provides a guide through the maze of theories and should help choose the appropriate concepts according to the stage of invasion.},

	abstract = {The oomycete Aphanomyces astaci is generally considered a parasite specific to freshwater crayfish, and it has become known as the crayfish plague pathogen. Old experimental work that reported transmission of crayfish plague to the Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis, and the ability of A. astaci to grow in non-decapod crustaceans, has never been tested properly. We re-evaluated the host range of A. astaci by screening for the presence of A. astaci in two crab species cohabiting with infected crayfish in fresh waters, as well as in other higher crustaceans from such localities. The animals were tested with species-specific quantitative PCR, and the pathogen determination was confirmed by sequencing of an amplified fragment of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer. Furthermore, we examined microscopically cuticle samples from presumably infected crab individuals for the presence of A. astaci-like hyphae and checked for the presence of pathogen DNA in such samples. Screenings of benthopelagic mysids, amphipods and benthic isopods did not suggest infection by A. astaci in non-decapod crustaceans. In contrast, both studied lake populations of crabs (a native semiterrestrial species Potamon potamios in Turkey, and an invasive catadromous E. sinensis in Sweden) were infected with this parasite according to both molecular and microscopic evidence. Analyses of polymorphic microsatellite loci demonstrated that A. astaci strains in the crabs and in cohabiting crayfish belonged to the same genotype group, suggesting crayfish as the source for crab infection. The potential for A. astaci transmission in the opposite direction, from crabs to crayfish, and potential impact of this pathogen on populations of freshwater crabs require further investigations, because of possible consequences for crayfish and freshwater crab conservation and aquaculture.},

This phenomenon could result in the extinction of endemic species. This study aims at investigating the hybridization dynamics between the endemic and threatened Lesser Antillean iguana (Iguana delicatissima) and the invasive common green iguana (Iguana iguana) in the Lesser Antilles, as well as assessing the impact of interspecific hybridization on the decline of I. delicatissima. 59 I. delicatissima (5 localities), 47 I. iguana (12 localities) and 27 hybrids (5 localities), who were all identified based on morphological characters, have been genotyped at 15 microsatellites markers. We also sequenced hybrids using ND4 mitochondrial loci to further investigate mitochondrial introgression. The genetic clustering of species and hybrid genetic assignment were performed using a comparative approach, through the implementation of a Discriminant Analysis of Principal Component (DAPC) based on statistics, as well as genetic clustering approaches based on the genetic models of several populations (Structure, NewHybrids and HIest), in order to get full characterization of hybridization patterns and introgression dynamics across the islands. The iguanas identified as hybrids in the wild, thanks to morphological analysis, were all genetically F1, F2, or backcrosses. A high proportion of individuals were also the result of a longer-term admixture. The absence of reproductive barriers between species leads to hybridization when species are in contact. Yet morphological and behavioral differences between species could explain why males I. iguana may dominate I. delicatissima, thus resulting in short-term species displacement and extinction by hybridization and recurrent introgression from I. iguana toward I. delicatissima. As a consequence, I. delicatissima gets eliminated through introgression, as observed in recent population history over several islands. These results have profound implications for species management of the endangered I. delicatissima and practical conservation recommendations are being discussed in the light of these findings.},

	abstract = {Aphanomyces astaci, the crayfish plague pathogen, first appeared in Europe in the mid-19th century and is still responsible for mass mortalities of native European crayfish. The spread of this parasite across the continent is especially facilitated by invasive North American crayfish species that serve as its reservoir. In France, multiple cases of native crayfish mortalities have been suggested to be connected with the presence of the signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus, which is highly abundant in the country. It shares similar habitats as the native white-clawed crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes and, when infected, the signal crayfish might therefore easily transmit the pathogen to the native species. We investigated the prevalence of A. astaci in French signal crayfish populations to evaluate the danger they represent to local populations of native crayfish. Over 500 individuals of Pacifastacus leniusculus from 45 French populations were analysed, plus several additional individuals of other non-indigenous crayfish species Orconectes limosus, O. immunis and Procambarus clarkii. Altogether, 20\% of analysed signal crayfish tested positive for Aphanomyces astaci, and the pathogen was detected in more than half of the studied populations. Local prevalence varied significantly, ranging from 0\% up to 80\%, but wide confidence intervals suggest that the number of populations infected by A. astaci may be even higher than our results show. Analysis of several individuals of other introduced species revealed infections among two of these, O. immunis and P. clarkii. Our results confirm that the widespread signal crayfish serves as a key reservoir of Aphanomyces astaci in France and therefore represents a serious danger to native crayfish species, especially the white-clawed crayfish. The prevalence in other non-indigenous crayfish should also be investigated as they likely contribute to pathogen transmission in the country.},

The clades A (including A1, A2, A3) and B are separated by a high genetic divergence (5\%).

The average of genetic divergence within the major group A and B was 2.1\% ± 1.2 and 0.9\% ± 0.6 respectively. Three clades A1, A2 and A3 correspond mainly to crayfish sampled from Austria-Switzerland, South of Balkans and Italy-Spain respectively.

So far, five genotype groups of this pathogen have been identified by applying random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis on axenic cultures. To allow genotyping of A. astaci in host tissue samples, we have developed co-dominant microsatellite markers for this pathogen, tested them on pure cultures of all genotype groups, and subsequently evaluated their use on tissues of (1) natural A. astaci carriers, i.e., North American crayfish species, and (2) A. astaci-infected indigenous European species from crayfish plague outbreaks. Out of over 200 potential loci containing simple sequence repeat (SSR) motifs identified by 454 pyrosequencing of SSR-enriched library, we tested 25 loci with highest number of repeats, and finally selected nine that allow unambiguous separation of all known RAPD-defined genotype groups of A. astaci from axenic cultures. Using these markers, we were able to characterize A. astaci strains from DNA isolates from infected crayfish tissues when crayfish had a moderate to high agent level according to quantitative PCR analyses. The results support the hypothesis that different North American crayfish hosts carry different genotype groups of the pathogen, and confirm that multiple genotype groups, including the one originally introduced to Europe in the 19th century, cause crayfish plague outbreaks in Central Europe. So far undocumented A. astaci genotype seems to have caused one of the analysed outbreaks from the Czech Republic. The newly developed culture-independent approach allowing direct genotyping of this pathogen in both axenic cultures and mixed genome samples opens new possibilities in studies of crayfish plague pathogen distribution, diversity and epidemiology.},

Four decamer primers which generated six unambiguous polymorphic bands were used to analyse crayfish from 21 populations sampled in the major part of its range. Genetic diversity within populations of A. pallipes, estimated by Shannon’s diversity index, ranged from 0 to 0.446 with a mean of 0.159. A UPGMA dendrogram constructed from pairwise ΦST values between populations, revealed three clusters corresponding to populations sampled in the southern, northwestern and eastern part of its range. AMOVA analysis revealed a high genetic structure of A. pallipes populations ΦST=0.814, with 73.11\% of the genetic variation distributed between these clusters. It suggests a historical geographical separation of these groups into three refugial areas, probably in the Rhine, Mediterranean and Atlantic basins during recent glaciations. The close genetic relationships between English and western French populations are in accordance with a natural postglacial origin of English populations from individuals having survived in an Atlantic refugium. However, the present results suggest that the Irish stock originated from a human translocation of individuals from an Atlantic refugium.},

The threatened status of this species shows the necessity to establish a suitable management to protect it. An efficient management requires an increase in our knowledge about existing populations. By using allometric relationships, we characterized the size at the onset of sexual maturity in both sexes and evaluated sexual dimorphism in this population. The size at the onset of sexual maturity appeared to be different in both sexes (20.1 mm POL in males and 18.17 mm POL in females). The sexual dimorphism, shown by the variables of claw length and abdominal width, was not closely related to the puberal moult. The growth rates of this population were very different from those shown by other European populations. Discriminant analysis was performed on the data, but it did not separate the juveniles of both sexes. This study provides fundamental results concerning the relative growth of A. pallipes which could be used to compare several French populations in the future. /// Ce travail porte sur le dimorphisme sexuel et sur la croissance allométrique d'une population française de l'écrevisse autochtone, Austropotamobius pallipes pallipes.

Le dimorphisme sexuel, montré par les variables largeur de la pince et largeur de l'abdomen, n'est pas étroitement lié à la mue de puberté. Les taux de croissance sont très différents de ceux trouvés pour d'autres populations européennes. L'analyse discriminante appliquée sur les même données n'a pas permis de séparer les juvéniles des deux sexes. Cette étude fournit des résultats fondamentaux sur la croissance relative d'A. pallipes; ils pourront être utilisés pour comparer plusieurs populations françaises.},

	abstract = {1. The white-clawed crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes has a widespread distribution in Europe, but since the last century its distribution has been severely affected by a combination of factors, particularly the disease crayfish plague, introduced by foreign crayfish species. At present A. pallipes is considered as vulnerable and endangered and measures are being taken in a number of countries to conserve it. 2. The application of genetics to conservation is of practical value particularly where restocking is being considered. This study assesses levels of genetic differentiation from an analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation by restriction fragment length polymorphism of four populations sampled on a European scale. Six different composite haplotypes were detected among sixty-four crayfish representing the four populations. mtDNA nucleon diversity values within species ranged from 0.63\% to 12.35\%. A close genetic similarity was found between British and French populations of A. pallipes. 3. Results show that mtDNA can be as a suitable diagnostic marker for measuring genetic diversity between crayfish populations and that such information is of use in planning crayfish conservation strategies.},

	abstract = {Pioneering investigations on the effects of introduced populations on community structure, ecosystem functioning and services have focused on the effects of invaders on taxonomic diversity. However, taxonomic-based diversity metrics overlook the heterogeneity of species roles within and among communities. As the homogenizing effects of biological invasions on community and ecosystem processes can be subtle, they may require the use of functional diversity indices to be properly evidenced. Starting from the listing of major functional diversity indices, alongside the presentation of their strengths and limitations, we focus on studies pertaining to the effects of invasive species on native communities and recipient ecosystems using functional diversity indices. By doing so, we reveal that functional diversity of the recipient community may strongly vary at the onset of the invasion process, while it stabilizes at intermediate and high levels of invasion. As functional changes occurring during the lag phase of an invasion have been poorly investigated, we show that it is still unknown whether there are consistent changes in functional diversity metrics that could indicate the end of the lag phase. Thus, we recommend providing information on the invasion stage under consideration when computing functional diversity metrics. For the existing literature, it is also surprising that very few studies explored the functional difference between organisms from the recipient communities and invaders of the same trophic levels, or assessed the effects of non-native organism establishment into a non-analogue versus an analogue community. By providing valuable tools for obtaining in-depth diagnostics of community structure and functioning, functional diversity indices can be applied for timely implementation of restoration plans and improved conservation strategies. To conclude, our work provides a first synthetic guide for their use in hypothesis testing in invasion biology.},

Two hypotheses have been formulated about the origin of the crayfish: from British populations or from western French populations. In order to resolve this question, nine Irish crayfish populations (a total of 124 individuals) were sampled along a south–north cline and investigated by combining two molecular markers: mtDNA and RAPDs. The mtDNA marker, analysed by RFLP on the entire molecule, showed an absence of polymorphism within and among Irish populations. The RFLP haplotype found in Irish populations was only recorded in western French populations and was different from those found in English populations. This result may be explained by a human introduction of crayfish to Ireland from western French populations. RAPD analysis showed a clinal reduction of genetic variability within Irish populations from south to north, associated with an increase in their genetic differentiation. A stepwise model of translocation from the south to the north of Ireland is proposed and discussed.},

Wolbachia induce feminization in many terrestrial isopod species, particularly in the genus Armadillidium (Crustacea, Oniscidea). The diversity of Wolbachia strains infecting Armadillidium species was examined. Results reveal that natural populations of A. vulgare contain three different Wolbachia strains (wVulC, wVulM and wVulP). The wsp gene and its 3′-adjacent region show evidence that two recombination events have occurred between two of these strains. In both cases, multiple statistical analyses suggest that a small gene fragment of a strain closely related to wVulM (minor parent) is inserted into the genome of another strain closely related to wVulC (major parent). Although multiple infections in a single individual have never been demonstrated in natural population, the existence of recombination between feminizing strains suggests that bi-infections are possible, or at least that bi-infections can be maintained sufficiently long enough to allow recombination. Recombination events increase genetic diversity of Wolbachia found in Armadillidium species and may play a role in the ability of Wolbachia strains to invade new hosts.},

Interpopulational genetic relationships showed that Spanish populations were closely related to those of Fosso di Ferfereta with a small genetic distance (0.0003) found between them.

	abstract = {1. In France, the distribution of the native white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes) is restricted, fragmented and mainly located in headwater streams. To conserve this indigenous species, it is necessary to characterize its habitat preferences. 2. Seven brooks in the Deux-Sèvres Département (western France) containing wild populations of A. pallipes were studied to determine its ranges of tolerance to 19 physical and chemical water parameters. On two brooks, the Sèvre Nantaise and the Verdonnière, sites with and without A. pallipes were compared. Each site was sampled twice monthly from November 2002 to November 2004. 3. It was found that the white-clawed crayfish was able to tolerate wide ranges of values of some of the measured parameters. The Magot site harboured the largest A. pallipes population (17.5 crayfish m−2) and had dissolved oxygen concentrations as low as 4.93 mg L−1, while water temperature rose above 20°C for several consecutive days during summer and nitrate concentrations were always found to be above 30 mg L−1. These unusual findings could call into question the status of A. pallipes as a bioindicator of good water quality. 4. Principal component analyses (PCA) suggested that an increase of organic matter was a discriminant factor for the presence or absence of A. pallipes. In addition, sites with and without crayfish on the Sèvre Nantaise brook showed showed significant differences (p{\textless}0.05) in total organic carbon (TOC), and those on the Verdonnière brook in turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS).

During a controlled infection experiment with a susceptible crayfish species Astacus astacus using three A. astaci strains (representing genotype groups A, B, and E), we investigated variation in their virulence and in crayfish immune defence indicators (haemocyte density, phenoloxidase activity, and production of reactive oxygen species). Experimental crayfish were exposed to two dosages of A. astaci spores (1 and 10sporesmL−1). The intensity and timing of the immune response differed between the strains as well as between the spore concentrations. Stronger and faster change in each immune parameter was observed in crayfish infected with two more virulent strains, indicating a relationship between crayfish immune response and A. astaci virulence. Similarly, the immune response was stronger and was observed earlier for the higher spore concentration. For the first time, the virulence of a strain of the genotype group E (isolated from Orconectes limosus) was experimentally tested. Total mortality was reached after 10days for the two higher spore dosages (10 and 100sporesmL−1), and after 16days for the lowest (1sporemL−1), revealing equally high and rapid mortality as caused by the genotype group B (from Pacifastacus leniusculus).

	abstract = {The North American spiny-cheek crayfish, Orconectes limosus (Rafinesque, 1817), a widespread invader in Europe, seems to have been introduced there successfully only once. According to available literature, 90 individuals of unclear origin were released in Poland in 1890. Despite this apparent bottleneck, the species has successfully colonized various aquatic habitats and has displaced native crayfish species in many places. To test whether different European populations were likely to have come from a single source and to identify their possible origin, we analyzed the diversity of the mitochondrial gene for cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) of O. limosus individuals from Europe and from its original range in North America, including the presumed source region of European populations, the Delaware River watershed (eastern USA). Two haplotypes were found in European populations. One haplotype was widespread; the other was present in a single population. In contrast, 18 haplotypes were detected in North America. This result supports the hypothesis of a single overseas introduction of O. limosus and suggests that the high invasion success of this species was not limited by an introduction bottleneck. Two divergent clades were detected in North American O. limosus populations. One, which includes the dominant haplotype in Europe, was found in a large part of the species’ present range. The 2nd (diverging by {\textgreater}1\%) was mostly restricted to a limited area in southeastern Pennsylvania. Orconectes limosus populations in the northern part of the species’ North American range, at least some of which are nonindigenous themselves, may share the source area with European O. limosus. The endangered status of O. limosus populations in southeastern Pennsylvania and northeastern Maryland, where much of the species’ genetic diversity resides, should be considered in conservation management.},

Here, we assess population differentiation in the freshwater crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, an endangered species endemic to western Europe and provide valuable information for the conservation of French populations. 2. Analysis of five microsatellite loci in 44 populations revealed very different within population levels of genetic diversity (0.000 {\textless} H0 {\textless} 0.564). Two groups, corresponding to northern and southern French populations, showed a high degree of genetic differentiation in both allele frequencies and allele sizes. Comparison of these results with previous studies of A. pallipes strongly suggests that the divergence between northern and southern populations could have occurred during the last glaciation period of the Pleistocene from one Atlantic and one Mediterranean refuge. 3. Evidence for genetic admixture between these two lineages was revealed by correspondence analyses in southern populations, probably as the result of artificial translocations. 4. French populations appeared significantly differentiated among the different river drainages and were highly structured within rivers. The impact of population size, population bottlenecks and founder events on the population genetic differentiation are discussed. 5. Based on these results, we propose the designation of two evolutionarily significant units for A. pallipes in France. Our data also support the maintenance of separate demographic management strategies for crayfish inhabiting different river systems. However, genetic analyses will have to be combined with demographic and ecological data for sustainable conservation programmes.},

Using species delimitation methods on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences, we propose four primary species hypotheses for WCC. Sequences for several nuclear regions were screened but none showed significant variation within WCC. This result favours a single secondary species hypothesis and indicates the existence of a mito-nuclear discordance in WCC. Therefore, mtDNA groups were considered only as genetic units that carry information about ancient divergences within WCC and not as taxonomic units. The reconstruction of ancestral ranges and divergence time estimates were used to link the current genetic structure with paleogeographic processes. These results showed that the emergence of mtDNA groups in WCC could be related to the Messinian Salinity Crisis, the climate cooling during the Pliocene and Pleistocene, and (paleo)shifting of the Adriatic Sea coastline in the Padanovenezian Plain. The most recent common ancestor of the mtDNA groups most likely originated from Dalmatia (eastern Adriatic coast) as indicated by the reconstruction of ancestral ranges. This ecoregion, along with the Gulf of Venice Drainages, harbours a high genetic diversity and should be emphasised as an area of the highest conservation priority.},

To address some outstanding issues in the relationships among Northern Hemisphere freshwater crayfish (Astacoidea), we sequenced the partial genome of crayfish species from Asian, North American and European genera and report the successful recovery of whole mitogenome sequences in addition to three highly repetitive nuclear genes, namely histone H3, 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA. Consistent with some previous studies using short mtDNA and nuclear gene fragments, phylogenetic analyses based on the concatenation of recovered mitochondrial and/or nuclear sequences recovered the Asian cambarid lineage as basal to all astacids and North American cambarids, which conflicts with the current taxonomic classification based on morphological and reproduction-related characters. Lastly, we show that complete H3, 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA genes can also be consistently recovered from a diverse range of animal taxa, demonstrating the potential wide utility of genome skimming for nuclear markers.},

We assessed the position of both known European populations within the species complex by sequencing part of the mitochondrial gene for cytochrome c oxidase subunit I. Tested UK and Dutch individuals did not belong to any mitochondrial lineage recorded in North America so far but formed a separate clade, the original distribution area of which is unknown. Additionally sequenced virile crayfish from Iowa (USA) also represented a new clade, suggesting that undiscovered lineage variation within O. virilis remains high.

To preserve this indigenous species, it is necessary to characterize its ecological requirements (water and habitat quality). With this aim in view, a two-year study is being conducted in the Deux-Sèvres department (Western France) since November 2002. Nine brooks from four different catchments are monitored regularly; eight of the nine brooks harbour whiteclawed crayfish populations. Two sampling sites are surveyed per brook, the first being where the crayfish population is located and the second 2 to 3 km downstream. Physicochemical parameters (18) are measured twice monthly and biotic factors are estimated twice yearly. In this study, the I.B.G.N. (Indice Biologique Global Normalisé) protocol based on the determination of macroinvertebrates was used as a biotic index of biological water quality. Results of this preliminary study on two brooks (Thouet and Verdonnière) show that physico-chemical and biological data considered separately do not provide reliable information about A. pallipes ecological requirements. However, the use of multivariate analyses (Principal Component Analysis) to combine abiotic and biotic factors highlights a good correlation between these parameters. Organic matter appears to be a better discriminating factor than mineral matter affecting presence or absence of the whiteclawed crayfish.},

	abstract = {The lesser Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean is known as a biodiversity hotspot, hosting many endemic species. However, recent introduction of a highly invasive species, the Australian redclaw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus), has led to significant threats to this fragile ecosystem. Here we developed, validated, and optimized a species-specific eDNA-based detection protocol targeting the 16S region of the mitochondrial gene of C. quadricarinatus. Our aim was to assess the crayfish distribution across Martinique Island. Our developed assay was species-specific and showed high sensitivity in laboratory, mesocosm and field conditions. A significant and positive correlation was found between species biomass, detection probability and efficiency through mesocosm experiments. Moreover, we found eDNA persisted up to 23 days in tropical freshwaters. We investigated a total of 83 locations, spread over 53 rivers and two closed water basins using our novel eDNA assay and traditional trapping, the latter, undertaken to confirm the reliability of the molecular-based detection method. Overall, we detected C. quadricarinatus at 47 locations using eDNA and 28 using traditional trapping, all positive trapping sites were positive for eDNA. We found that eDNA-based monitoring was less time-consuming and less influenced by the crayfishes often patchy distributions, proving a more reliable tool for future large-scale surveys. The clear threat and worrying distribution of this invasive species is particularly alarming as the archipelago belongs to one of the 25 identified biodiversity hotspots on Earth.},

They have limited dispersal abilities and rely on the connectivity between habitats and their suitability. In a warming climate, the locations of suitable habitats are expected to change, as is the connectivity. Here, we wondered how climate change might affect shifts in habitat suitability and connectivity of habitat patches, as connectivity is a key element enabling species to realize a potential range shift. We used ecological niche modelling (ENM), combining large-scale climate suitability with local scale, high-resolution habitat features, to identify suitable areas for the two species, under low and high warming scenarios (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5). We associated it with connectivity assessment through graph theory. The variable ‘small ponds’ contributed most to land cover-only ENMs for both species. Projections with climate change scenarios revealed a potential impact of warming on suitable habitat patches for newts, especially for T. cristatus. We observed a decrease in connectivity following a decrease in patch suitability. Our results highlight the important areas for newt habitat connectivity within the study area, and define those potentially threatened by climate warming. We provide information for prioritizing sites for acquisition, protection or restoration, and to advise landscape policies. Our framework is a useful and easily reproducible way to combine global climate requirements of the species with detailed information on species habitats and occurrence when available.},

However, a few exceptions do exist and among them two terrestrial isopods Armadillidium vulgare and Porcellionides pruinosus have an atypical mtDNA composed of linear monomers associated with circular “head-to-head” dimers: a very unusual structure for animal mtDNA genome. To assess the distribution of this atypical mtDNA among isopods, we performed RFLP and Southern blot analyses on mtDNA of 16 terrestrial (Oniscidea family) and two aquatic isopod species: the marine Sphaeroma serratum (suborder Flabellifera, sister group of Oniscidea) and the freshwater Asellus aquaticus (Asellota, early derived taxon of isopod). The atypical mtDNA structure was observed in 15 terrestrial isopod species and A. aquaticus, suggesting a wide distribution of atypical mtDNA among isopods. However, a typical metazoan mtDNA structure was detected in the marine isopod S. serratum and the Oniscidea Ligia oceanica. Our results suggest two possible scenarios: an early origin of the atypical mtDNA in isopods followed by reversion to the typical ancestral mtDNA structure for several species, or a convergent appearance of the atypical mtDNA structure in two isopod suborders. We compare this distribution of the atypical mtDNA structure with the presence of a heteroplasmy also observed in the mtDNA of several terrestrial isopod species. We discuss if this transmitted heteroplasmy is vectored by the atypical mtDNA and its impact on the maintenance of the atypical mtDNA in isopods.},

MtDNA analysis by RFLP using 6 endonucleases revealed 5 haplotypes and allowed unequivocal identification of the subspecies. The nucleotide sequence divergence among haplotypes characteristic of each subspecies ranged from 10.93-13.6\% and may be explained by an ancient geographical separation of each subspecies. This distribution of genetic variation agrees with the presumption of 3 refugial regions during the glaciation periods, possibly the Iberian Peninsula, southern France, and the Balkans.

	abstract = {1. A study on the genetic variability of the white-clawed crayfish was carried out based on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene sequences. The sequences applied were more informative regarding white-clawed crayfish genetic variability than others previously used. 2. Two haplotypes were found to exist in the Iberian Peninsula. The haplotypes exhibit a strong geographic subdivision (ΦST=0.83). One of the Iberian haplotypes was similar to north Italian haplotypes and the second differed in only one mutation. This pattern of genetic variability contrasts with those found in glacial refugial areas of France, Italy and the Balkan Peninsula. 3. Two hypotheses on the origin of the white-clawed crayfish in the Iberian Peninsula are discussed: (i) one based on an anthropogenic origin, and (ii) a second based on a successive number of postglacial ancient and recent bottlenecks, i.e. the disjunction between Iberian and Italian populations of white-clawed crayfish species is due to competition between A. italicus and A. pallipes, in addition to the impact of crayfish plague and human translocations. 4. New references for the white-clawed crayfish in the Iberian Peninsula were found in medieval and Arabic texts. The results show that this species has been thriving in this peninsula since ancient periods and that its indigenous status should not be questioned. 5. Conservation action and plans should consider the low genetic diversity as a limitation for farm-raising specimens more adapted and resistant to changing environments and diseases.

	abstract = {The white-clawed crayfish, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Austropotamobius pallipes pallipes{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, still has a wide-spread distribution in France, but since the last century, populations have declined because of habitat alteration (due to human disturbance) and have been also eliminated by crayfish plague, for which introduced exotic species are a vector. Action plans for the conservation of {\textless}i{\textgreater}A. pallipes{\textless}i/{\textgreater} are urgent and if recovery programmes are to be initiated in France, then it is important to estimate how much genetic variation is partitioned between remaining populations as the species is being currently threatened in all its European distribution. We show how a new molecular marker can be used to study crayfish populations. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation in natural populations was examined by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in samples taken from fifteen French populations and six European populations representative of three subspecies observed in {\textless}i{\textgreater}A. pallipes{\textless}i/{\textgreater} in order to examine the extent of differentiation between populations. Biogeographic considerations about the genetic distances observed between the three subspecies are made. The study reveals a low level of genetic variation among English, Welsh and most of French populations, corresponding to a genetic stock uniformity among {\textless}i{\textgreater}A. pallipes pallipes{\textless}i/{\textgreater} . The only two French populations exhibiting a high level of intrapopulational genetic variation are in fact mixed samples : the comparison with results obtained in European populations revealed that the first population was composed of the two subspecies {\textless}i{\textgreater}A. pallipes pallipes{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}A. pallipes italicus{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and the second of {\textless}i{\textgreater}A. pallipes italicus{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}A. pallipes lusitanicus{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. Results proved that some repopulations, performed in the past from {\textless}i{\textgreater}A. pallipes italicus{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and supposed having failed, have been successful and that the French stock did not correspond to the only subspecies {\textless}i{\textgreater}A. pallipes pallipes{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. A first analysis of genetic variance observed on a regional scale revealed that there was no genetic structure according to basins and could reflect human-mediated movement of crayfish stocks between these basins. Consequently, mtDNA is an essential marker to measure genetic diversity between crayfish populations, to map how the subspecies are partitioned in France and what the importance of each is before any planning crayfish conservation strategies of the native crayfish},

	abstract = {1. IntroductionThe Decapoda represent a highly speciose and diverse group of crustaceans that provide important ecosystem services across mainly marine and freshwater environments, with many of the larger species being of significant commercial importance for fisheries and aquaculture industries. The value of generating and using genomic resources for key crustacean species and groups is widely appreciated for a variety of purposes including phylogenetic and population studies, selective breeding programs and broodstock management (Tan et al., 2016; Grandjean et al., 2017; Wolfe et al., 2019; Zenger et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). However, comprehensive genomic studies are particularly limited for decapod crustaceans (Zenger et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019), compared to other aquatic invertebrate groups. Most genomic-related studies on decapod crustaceans have focused on mitogenome recovery and transcriptomics studies, with few genome assemblies attempted and most of these on commercially-important species (Song et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019). Of the decapod species for which genome assemblies have been published and are publicly available, the quality is highly variable and BUSCO completeness poor with the exception of Procambarus virginalis (87.0\%) and Litopeneaus vannamei (84.6\%) (Table 1). It is now apparent that the assembly and annotation of decapod genomes are highly challenging due to the need to deal with large repetitive genomes, often with high heterozygosity, and should not to be undertaken by the faint-hearted or on a shoe-string budget (Zhang et al., 2019).The lack of genomic resources coupled with limited understanding of the molecular basis of gene expression and phenotypic variation will continue to limit advances in aquaculture-based productivity of decapods. Understanding the molecular basis of phenotypic variation and gene function is therefore important for selective breeding programs for traits such as increased growth and disease resistance (Zenger et al., 2019). Similarly, whole genome assemblies support genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify trait-specific loci and for genomic-based selective breeding.Freshwater crayfishes make up an important group of Decapod crustaceans (Crandall and De Grave, 2017) naturally occurring on all continents, with the exception of Antarctica and Africa (Toon et al., 2010; Bracken-Grissom et al., 2014). They reach their greatest species richness in Australia and north America. A number of species are subject to aquaculture and recreational, and indigenous and bait fisheries, and others are of conservation concern due to a range of activities threatening vulnerable freshwater environments (Piper, 2000; Richman et al., 2015; CABI, 2019). The genomic architecture and karyotype evolution of freshwater crayfish is also of interest as they have some of the largest chromosome numbers (2n=200) recorded for invertebrate species (Tan et al., 2004). In Australia, freshwater crayfish species from the genus Cherax Erichson, known as smooth yabbies, include the largest commercial crayfish species in the world (Austin, 1987; 1996; Austin and Knott, 1996). Of these, the economically-important and best known is the red claw crayfish, Cherax quadricarinatus von Martens, distributed widely across northern Australia (Austin, 1996; FAO, 2019). The species is capable of growing to greater than 200 grams making it the second largest commercial species of Cherax (Austin, 1987) behind the marron (C. cainii Austin) (Austin and Ryan, 2002). The popularity of the red claw as an aquaculture and ornamental species and its adaptability has resulted in widespread translocation, resulting in an extensive global distribution and it is acknowledged as a major invasive species of inland aquatic ecosystems in the tropics (Ahyong and Yeo, 2007; Larson and Olden, 2013; Saoud et al., 2013). Due to its large size and ease with which it can be maintained in captivity, C. quadricarinatus is also increasingly being used as a model organism to address fundamental questions relevant to molecular biology, physiology, functional genomics and cell biology (Fern\&\#225;ndez et al., 2012; Pamuru et al., 2012; Ventura et al., 2019).The genetics of C. quadricarinatus has been well studied using PCR-based approaches and recently, next generation sequencing has been used for mitogenomic and transcriptomic studies (Baker et al., 2008; Gan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2016). In this paper, we present the first genome assembly for a southern hemisphere crayfish using a hybrid assembly approach utilising long Nanopore reads and short Illumina reads, which has proven to be an efficient and effective approach for the assembly and annotation of species with large and repetitive genomes (Austin et al., 2017; Tan et al., 2018; Gan et al., 2019; S\&\#225;nchez-Herrero et al., 2019), but has only been minimally explored to support decapod assemblies (Van Quyen et al., 2020).We then benchmark our assembly against seven other published decapod genome assemblies and present a preliminary phylogenomic analysis for decapod crustaceans. Lastly, we use these data to investigate the occurrence and diversification of nuclear mitochondrial DNA (NUMTs) in decapod genomes, which is directly relevant to debates on the veracity of the most common approach to the DNA barcoding of life for molecular-based taxonomic identification and biodiversity assessment based on the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (cox1) gene region (Hebert et al., 2003; Cristescu, 2014; deWaard et al., 2018).2. Materials and Methods2.1 Data generationTissue samples from two male C. quadricarinatus individuals were collected from Northern Territory in Australia, DWN1 from Rapid Creek and M2R2 from Charles Darwin University Aquaculture Centre, both located in Darwin following institutionally endorsed ethical, biosecurity and safety guidelines. Genomic DNA was extracted using E.Z.N.A.\&\#174; Tissue DNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek) from tail muscle tissue. One microgram of DWN1 was sent to Macrogen, Korea for PCR-free library preparation and sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Additional Illumina sequencing on the Novaseq6000 was also performed at Deakin Genomics Centre using a PCR-based library constructed with NEBNext Ultra Illumina library preparation kit. Using tissue samples from DWN1 and M2R2 individuals, for each Nanopore library, approximately 1 ug of gDNA as measured by Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen) was processed using the LSK108 library preparation kit followed by sequencing on the R9.4 MinION flowcell. Nanopore data was basecalled with Albacore versions compatible with kits and flowcells used (discontinued, was available on https://community.nanoporetech.com) and adapter-trimmed with the Porechop tool (Wick, 2017).2.2 De novo assembly and scaffolding of the crayfish genomeRaw reads were pre-processed prior to assembly. The fastp tool (--poly\_g\_min\_len 1) (Chen et al., 2018) was used to trim polyG sequences from the 3’ end of reads generated on the Illumina NovaSeq platform. All short reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014) to eliminate adapters (ILLUMINACLIP:2:30:10) and low quality sequences (AVGQUAL:20), and subsequently assembled with the Platanus assembler (Kajitani et al., 2014) using default parameters. The repeat content and large size of this genome necessitated scaffolding of the assembly with several data types; these included the use of short and long reads in order to span gaps of various sizes, in addition to using data from a previous C. quadricarinatus transcriptome project (Tan et al., 2016) to stitch together scaffolds containing coding genes. A first level of scaffolding was performed with Platanus, which scaffolds the assembled contigs and further closes gaps with insert size and sequence information from short paired-end libraries. Subsequently, a second level of scaffolding was accomplished with long Nanopore reads using LINKS (Warren et al., 2015), which was run for 20 iterations with multiple distance values (d) and step of sliding window (t), in addition to set values for k-mer (-k 19), minimum number of links (-l 5) and maximum link ratio between two best pairs (-a 0.3). Detailed parameters used in each iteration is available as Data Sheet 1. Resulting scaffolds were polished with pilon v1.22 (--fix all) (Walker et al., 2014) for five iterations. A third scaffolding step was performed using C. quadricarinatus RNA-seq reads previously generated (ERP004477) (Tan et al., 2016). HISAT2 was used to align RNA-seq reads to the assembly, information from which was used by BESST (Sahlin et al., 2014) for further scaffolding. All assemblies were evaluated for ‘completeness’ based on the detection of single copy conserved genes (arthropoda\_odb9) with BUSCO (Sim\&\#227;o et al., 2015).2.3 Genome size estimationJellyfish (Mar\&\#231;ais and Kingsford, 2011) was used to count the occurrence of 19-, 21- and 25-mers in pre-processed short reads, generating a k-mer frequency histogram that was uploaded to the GenomeScope webserver (max kmer coverage disabled) (Vurture et al., 2017) for an estimation of haploid genome size, heterozygosity and repetitive content.2.4 Gene prediction and functional annotationA first iteration of the MAKER v2.31.10 annotation pipeline (Cantarel et al., 2008) was run to produce initial gene models based on transcript and protein hints (est2genome=1; protein2genome=1) from C. quadricarinatus transcriptome sequences (Tan et al., 2016), protein sequences from UniProt-SwissProt (Consortium, 2018) and an additional set of proteins from four other published decapod genomes: Eriocheir sinensis (Song et al., 2016), Litopenaeus vannamei (Zhang et al., 2019), Marsupenaeus japonicus and Penaeus monodon (Yuan et al., 2018). These gene models were used to train two ab initio gene predictors, SNAP (Korf, 2004) and AUGUSTUS (Stanke et al., 2006), which were provided in a second MAKER iteration. Gene models resulting from this iteration were again used to retrain SNAP and AUGUSTUS before a third and final iteration of MAKER. Genes with Annotation Edit Distance values (AED) ≤ 0.5 were retained (Eilbeck et al., 2009). A small AED value points to a lesser degree of variance between the predicted gene and evidences/hints used in prediction. For functional annotation, DIAMOND (Buchfink et al., 2014) was used to find homology between the predicted genes and known proteins in the UniProtKB (Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL) database (Consortium, 2018). The predicted protein sequences were also scanned for motifs, signatures and protein domains using InterProScan (Jones et al., 2014).2.5 Comparative analyses of published decapod genomesPublicly-available genome assemblies for seven published decapod species (Eriocheir sinensis, Exopalaemon carinicauda, Litopenaeus vannamei, Marsupenaeus japonicus, Neocaridina denticulata, Penaeus monodon, Procambarus virginalis) (Kenny et al., 2014; Song et al., 2016; Gutekunst et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019) and three other non-decapod crustaceans (Daphnia pulex, Eulimnadia texana, Parhyale hawaiensis) (Colbourne et al., 2011; Kao et al., 2016; Baldwin-Brown et al., 2017) were downloaded (sources in Table 1) and compared in terms of genome and assembly sizes, repeat content and completeness. ‘Completeness’ of a genome was assessed with BUSCO (Sim\&\#227;o et al., 2015) based on the arthropoda\_odb9 databases. To obtain repeat profiles, repeat families were identified de novo using RepeatModeler (Smit and Hubley, 2019), which uses RepeatScout (Price et al., 2005) and RECON (Bao and Eddy, 2002) to scan for repeats. The output from this step contains a set of consensus sequences from each identified repeat family that was used by RepeatMasker (Smit et al., 2019) to mask repeats within the assembly.2.6 Preliminary detection of NUMTsThe eight assembled genomes for C. quadricarinatus, Er. sinensis, Ex. carinicauda, L. vannamei, M. japonicus, N. denticulata, Pe. monodon and Pr. virginalis were also scanned for the presence of putative NUMTs. The blastn tool (Altschul et al., 1990) was used to align the mitochondrial cox1 gene of each species to its corresponding genome (exception: Procambarus clarkii cox1 was used since the full cox1 sequence for Pr. virginalis is unavailable on NCBI). Each output was filtered to eliminate alignments based on the following criteria:1. Alignment length \&lt; 100 nucleotides2. Alignment length that spans 95\% of a genomic scaffold3. Alignment at the edge of a genomic scaffoldAn illustration of how these filters were applied is provided in Data Sheet 6. Sequences of these putative NUMTs were extracted based on alignment start and stop coordinates and were aligned with MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013). IQ-TREE (Nguyen et al., 2014) was used to perform model testing and construct a maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree (-m TESTMERGE).2.7 Phylogenetic analysesA ML tree was also constructed based on orthologous protein sequences predicted by BUSCO. This tree consists of six decapods (C. quadricarinatus, Er. sinensis, L. vannamei, M. japonicus, Pe. monodon, Pr. virginalis) with D. pulex, Eu. texana and Pa. hawaiensis as non-decapod outgroup species, rooted with Drosophila melanogaster. Since this analysis used sequences predicted by BUSCO, N. denticulata and Ex. carinicauda with low BUSCO completeness were excluded from this analysis. Briefly, protein sequences within each orthologous group (based on metazoa\_odb9 and arthropoda\_odb9) were aligned with MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and trimmed with Gblocks (Castresana, 2000). Only multiple sequence alignments containing sequences from all ten species were retained and concatenated into a supermatrix with FASconCat-G (K\&\#252;ck and Longo, 2014). IQ-TREE (Nguyen et al., 2014) was used for initial model testing and construction of the ML tree (-m TESTMERGE), with support values indicated by the SH-like approximate likelihood ratio test (SH-aLRT) (Guindon et al., 2010) and ultrafast bootstrap (UFBoot) (Minh et al., 2013) (-alrt 1000 -bb 1000).3. Results and Discussion3.1 A giant genome for a large freshwater crayfishThis study produced 191 Gbp of HiSeq data (2\&\#215;100 bp) and 774 Gbp of NovaSeq data (2\&\#215;150 bp) in addition to 36 Gbp of Nanopore reads (average: 3,419 bp) to assist with scaffolding. Kmer-based methods estimated a 5 Gbp size for the Cherax quadricarinatus genome (Data Sheet 2), a value that is within the 3.82 to 6.06 Gbp size range that has been reported for species in the Infraorder Astacidea (Gregory, 2019) (Figure 1A). Based on this estimate, data generated in this study yields sequencing depths of 193\&\#215; and 7\&\#215; of short and long reads, respectively. Sequence data is available in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) on NCBI (BioProject: PRJNA559771).3.2 Characteristics of the C. quadricarinatus genomeHybrid assembly of this genome resulted in a 3.24 Gbp final assembly contained in 508,682 scaffolds, with a N50 length of 33,235 bp (Table 1). Details of each assembly at each scaffolding level are available in Data Sheet 3. The BUSCO tool reports the presence of 81.3\% and 12.8\% of complete and fragmented arthropod BUSCOs, respectively. These values are comparable to the completeness evaluation of other recently sequenced decapod genomes that are relatively much smaller (L. vannamei, Pr. virginalis, Er. sinensis) (Table 1, Figure 1B). GenomeScope profiles display a small shoulder on k-mer distributions, indicating some level of heterozygosity within the genome and estimated an average heterozygosity level of 0.44\%, which translates into approximately 1 mutation in 230 bp (Data Sheet 2). This is on par with the heterozygosity level of 0.53\% reported for the marbled crayfish, Pr. virginalis (Gutekunst et al., 2018), and is higher than in prawns with both M. japonicus and Pe. Monodon, both with 0.19\% and 0.21\% heterozygosity, respectively (Yuan et al., 2018). In addition, 33.73\% of this assembly was masked for repeats, with a large proportion of interspersed repeats being long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), representing a repeat profile that is similar to that of Pr. virginalis, another crayfish species (Figure 1C). While the report of only 5.9\% missing BUSCO genes in this C. quadricarinatus assembly suggests that majority of the gene space is present, the assembly reported in this study makes up only 64.8\% of the expected 5 Gbp genome with 85.2\% of short reads successfully mapped back to the assembly, indicating that there remains regions of this large genome that are missing from the assembly. This is not unusual for decapod genomes as they are rarely assembled to their full size, as seen from data points in Figure 1A, which mostly fall well below the “line of identity” between assembly vs genome size. The exception being Pr. virginalis with an assembled size close to its 3.5 Gbp genome size. This study tackles the ambitious assembly of a gigantic genome riddled with large repetitive structures and heterozygous regions that pose serious challenges to computational and bioinformatic resources, but there are clear benefits to hybrid assembly as an efficient method to add to the limited pool of genomic resources available for the order Decapoda. This assembly is available on NCBI (BioProject: PRJNA559771, WGS: VSFE00000000). It is noteworthy that this study has incorporated the largest dataset of long Nanopore reads to date for a decapod genome assembly (36 Gbp, {\textasciitilde}7\&\#215;), the other being the recent updated assembly of the black tiger prawn genome that incorporated the use of 2.5 Gbp of long Nanopore reads ({\textasciitilde}1.25\&\#215;) (Van Quyen et al., 2020). The only other study to use long reads in decapod whole genome research is by Zhang et al. (2019) who utilised PacBio reads to support the assembly of the genome for the Pacific white shrimp L. vannamei.3.3 Predicted genes and functionalAn average of 95.4\% of RNA-seq reads from five C. quadricarinatus tissue types in Tan et al. (2016) were successfully aligned to the assembly. The annotation process predicted a total of 19,494 protein-coding genes (Data Sheet 3), with an average gene length of 9,768 bp containing an average of 4.4 exons per gene. This number of predicted genes is within the range of that typically reported for other decapod crustaceans (Er. sinensis: 14436, M. japonicus: 16716, Pe. monodon: 18100, Pr. virginalis: 21772, L. vannamei: 25596). Of the annotated protein-coding genes, 88\% are functionally annotated based on homology to existing UniProt protein sequences or through identification of protein domains and signatures. Protein and transcript sequences, BLAST homology alignments and InterProScan results are available as Data Sheet 4.3.4 Decapod evolution based on nuclear genesAlignment and trimming of 97 orthologous genes resulted in a supermatrix of 16,679 amino acid characters. Maximum-likelihood analysis based on these protein sequences generated the tree shown in Figure 1D. Rooted with the fruit fly, the phylogeny recovers branchiopods and amphipods as outgroup species to the decapod species. Shrimp and prawn species (L. vannamei, M. japonicus, Pe. monodon) are clustered in a clade as the Dendrobranchiata, which in turn forms a sister relationship with a second clade consisting of the other three decapod species. In this latter clade, crayfish species are placed as sister taxa (C. quadricarinatus and Pr. virginalis), consistent with their taxonomic status as species within Astacidea, but with surprisingly weak nodal support (SH-aLRT 55.1\%, UFBoot 66.0\%). These relationships are consistent with findings reported in mitogenome- and nuclear-based studies (Bracken et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2013; Tan et al., 2019; Wolfe et al., 2019). Alignment and phylogenetic tree produced in this analysis are available as Data Sheet 5.3.5 Integration of the mitochondrial cox1 gene into decapod genomesThe concept of DNA barcoding, by which a short universal DNA sequence is used to discriminate among species, is being very widely used to support taxonomic identification, detection of cryptic species and for establishing a reference database to support ecological, biodiversity and conservation-related studies (Ratnasingham and Hebert, 2007). A relatively recent and potentially powerful application of barcoding is the use of the rapidly increasing COI database as a reference for supporting environmental DNA metabarcoding studies (Deiner et al., 2017; G\&\#252;nther et al., 2018). However, DNA barcoding has its critics (Moritz and Cicero, 2004; Collins and Cruickshank, 2013), with a persistent concern being the impact of mitochondrial DNA copies in the nuclear genome (Bensasson et al., 2001; Hazkani-Covo et al., 2010) on the veracity of the DNA barcoding methodology, potentially making DNA barcoding unreliable for certain taxonomic groups (Sorenson and Quinn, 1998), including crustaceans (Song et al., 2008).NUMTs have now been reported in a diversity of animal groups including crustaceans, with cytochrome oxidase 1 (cox1) NUMTs found in planktonic copepods (Bucklin et al., 1999) and snapping shrimp (Williams and Knowlton, 2001). Nguyen et al. (2002) and Munasinghe et al. (2003) reported the first NUMTs for crayfish, from the genus Cherax, and Song et al. (2008) for species of Orconectes. Our study extends the findings of Song et al. (2008) in that we identify cox1 pseudogenes in each of the decapod genome assemblies we have examined, but find the number to be widely variable among taxa. This analysis identified the most cox1 pseudogenes in C. quadricarinatus (34 insertion sites), followed by Pe. monodon (11), Pr. virginalis (8), M. japonicus (6), Ex. carinicauda (5), N. denticulata (3), Er. sinensis (2) and L. vannamei (1) (Figure 1E). NUMTs identified from these decapod species form monophyletic groups by species in the phylogeny, suggesting that the cox1 mitochondrial gene was integrated into each nuclear genome subsequent to the divergence of species in this analysis, with either multiple independent transfer events or further evolution of NUMTs within each species through duplication events. The NUMT phylogenetic tree is available in Data Sheet 5.In a broad-based study of NUMTs in 85 eukaryotic genomes, Hazkani-Covo et al. (2010) found a correlation with genome size. While finding the highest number of NUMTs in the red claw crayfish, with the second largest decapod genome assembled, is consistent with this observation, the evidence for a similar overall trend is not so clear across all the decapod species. In this context, it should be noted that we only have a relatively small sampling of decapod genomes and the varying assembly quality and volume of sequence data among studies makes testing this hypothesis fraught at this stage. There are also several caveats associated with this analysis. The identification process is dependent on the search methods and implemented filters, which if too conservative, can limit detection and exclude true NUMTs with highly divergent and variable sequences, especially if the time of insertion form the mitogenome occurred millions of years ago (Tsuji et al., 2012). It is also unknown whether other published decapod studies have been post-processed to exclude scaffolds containing mitochondrial genes during the submission process to databases. Nevertheless, results from this analysis provide an insight into the prevalence of NUMTs in decapod genomes, encouraging further exploration into the evolution of NUMTs in future studies.4. ConclusionFollowing on from mitogenomic and transcriptomic studies, we present the first draft genome for the red claw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) based on relatively large volumes of short and long genomic reads from Illumina and Oxford Nanopore (ONT) platforms. While the assembly is relatively fragmented, it is much better than many of those currently available for decapod species, and the quality of the annotation is equivalent to other more recently-sequenced decapod genomes. Due to the very large size and repetitive structures of the red claw genome, the assembly was highly challenging. However, we demonstrated the value of long Nanopore reads and a hybrid assembly approach for improving an assembly based on short reads alone (Data Sheet 3), which gives encouragement for tackling other crayfish and crustacean taxa with large and complex genomes. This draft genome will be an important and valuable resource to support ongoing comparative genomic, phylogenomics and molecular-based breeding studies for aquaculture, conservation and biodiversity-related studies and can be approved upon over time, with the generation of additional long read data. However, a major challenge still remains in relation to the computational resources needed to assemble large repetitive genomes from predominately short reads, even when aided with long reads (Lewin et al., 2018). Computationally, assembly, scaffolding and polishing processes to achieve the final draft genome took almost 85 processor-weeks, and annotation required another 100 processor-weeks. A worthwhile next step would be to investigate the efficacy of a long-read led crayfish genome assembly, now feasible as result of declining costs and improved accuracy of long read sequencing, and which should be less expensive and lead to greatly reduced processor time for assembly tasks.Data availabilityThe datasets generated for this study can be found in the NCBI BioProject PRJNA559771, BioSamples SAMN12558911 and SAMN12885547 (WGS accession: VSFE00000000; SRA accessions: SRR10214688, SRR10416208, SRR10416210, SRR10445782, SRR10445783, SRR10445784, SRR10484712).Author ContributionsCA, HG and LC conceived the project.

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide released in the atmosphere and dissolved in water leads to acidification. Relatively few studies have focused on fresh waters, where biocalcifying species are more readily impacted by changes in pH. Sensitivity to pH of an endangered calcium-demanding organism, the crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, was investigated in the Pinail nature reserve, a natural system with 3000 permanent ponds, some inhabited by the crayfish and others not, originally due to human introduction. From the 14 chemical parameters measured in this study, the main limiting factor preventing crayfish establishment appears to be water acidity (pH {\textless} 6.8), which affects calcification, molting, growth and reproduction. We predict that 20\% of the Pinail populations will disappear by 2060 due to freshwater acidification with the present level of fossil fuel consumption. Ongoing and future restoration projects for conservation of this heritage crustacean must select hard water with the highest water pH ({\textgreater} 7).},

Here, we assess the population differentiation in the Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, listed in Annex II of the European Habitats Directive, to provide valuable information for its conservation in Normandy (France). 2. Samples collected from 10 natural sites revealed that 13 of 14 microsatellite loci were polymorphic. Significant differentiation among populations was detected (FST = 0.054, P {\textless} 0.001), and all FST pairwise comparisons except one were significant. A genetic split was observed between populations inhabiting streams with limestone geology compared to those inhabiting streams with siliceous geology, which could reflect adaptative differences. 3. Hatchery stocks used for the restocking of two rivers were genetically distinct from native stocks. 4. Analysis of three stream habitats restored in 1995 showed that all were recolonized naturally by wild salmon from geographically close populations and no founder effects were detected. Allelic richness was similar between recolonized and wild populations. 5. From a management perspective, our study revealed that restoration of habitat is very effective to recreate new populations in rivers from which salmon have disappeared and that natural recolonization can be fast and effective in terms of genetic diversity.},

Eight populations of A. i. italicus, analyzed for their microsatellite loci, showed a low intra-population genetic variability and a high inter-population genetic divergence. Populations sampled in the Sieve basin showed no heterozygotes and a high level of inbreeding. The knowledge on the genetic structure of the studied populations, combined with information on their ethology, ecology, and demography, is an essential prerequisite for any action aimed at reintroducing or restocking this threatened species.},

Additional 118 localities in Croatia and 8 locations in Bosnia and Herzegovina were added to already known 160 localities from the literature data. Molecular analyses of mitochondrial DNA indicate: (i) the presence of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Phoxinus marsilii{\textless}i/{\textgreater} in Croatia (Drava drainage, the Papuk Mountain), around 260 km south of its known distribution range in Hungary, and (ii) an exceptional genetic variability of {\textless}i{\textgreater}P. lumaireul{\textless}i/{\textgreater} in the Western Balkans.},

Ten populations of Austropotamobius italicus from the Marches region (Central Italy), two populations from the Appennines of Calabria and Basilicata (Southern Italy) and four populations from Friuli Venezia Giulia region were sampled to elucidate the geographical pattern of genetic variability in relation to recent and historical factors. 2. A total of nine COI haplotypes belonging to three separate lineages have been characterized. Both lineage A (Northern Marches region) and C (Friuli Venezia Giulia region) were represented by one haplotype and were related to the Istria 1 peninsula and SouthAlps/Western Balkans lineages respectively. The lineage B included seven haplotypes belonging to the Appenines lineage. 3. Two hypotheses on the origin of individuals belonging to the Istrian lineage in Marches are discussed: (i) a natural colonization from the Istria peninsula refugia by migrating westwards across the bridge between the Istria peninsula and Italy, (ii) an anthropogenic origin. Based on 16S rRNA sequences, the taxonomic status of lineage B and C, defined from COI mtDNA markers, belongs to A. i. meridionalis and that of lineage A belongs to A. i. carsicus. The existence of a complex geographic structure between Marches populations (Φst=0.66) of A. i. meridionalis should be further considered in conservation management.

	abstract = {Sex determination in Armadillidium vulgare may be under the control of two parasitic sex factors that reverse genetic males into functional neo-females. The first feminizing factor (F) is a Wolbachia and the other (f) is probably a sequence of the F bacterial DNA unstably integrated into the host genome. Both of these feminizing factors are mainly maternally transmitted. Here we investigate the mitochondrial DNA polymorphism of wild iso-female lineages harbouring either F or f. Among the four haplotypes present in the population, two were the f-harbouring lineages, while two were common to the F- and f-harbouring lineages. This result suggests that there has been an introgression of the f factor into lineages infected by F Wolbachia. Based on previous data, we propose two different ways to account for such introgression. Given the particular dynamics of feminizing factors (f-harbouring lineages increase in populations at the expense of F-harbouring lineages), such an introgression should prevent the replacement of F-linked mitochondrial types by f-linked mitochondrial types in wild populations.},

Its aim was to increase our understanding of these ecosystems to help the conservation of A. pallipes. These brooks run through pastoral areas with well-developed riparian vegetation, which offers an important shade. Water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, and conductivity fell within the ranges found for this species. A total of 34, 31, 29 taxa and 1 502, 1 364, 2 707 individuals of macrobenthos were collected in Holme, Besque and Bellecombe streams, respectively. Results showed good to very good water quality with IBGN scores ranging from 15 (Bellecombe) to 17 (Holme and Besque), reflecting a limited impact of the anthropogenic disturbances. Taxa diversity were high for Holme and Besque with Shannon index around 3.2, translating a great heterogeneity of habitat and an equilibrated faunal community. Bellecombe showed a limited diversity with Shannon index of 1.42, resulting from the presence of numberous Chironomidae. This brook suffers probably weak organic pollution which could be related to the low water flow observed during the sampling. The similarity test according to Jaccard index showed high percentage of common taxa among ETP (Ephemeroptera-Trichoptera-Plecoptera) between all sites. The high similarity of benthic macroinvertebrate communities could be an useful criteria to identify brooks for restocking purpose.},

Drawing on both morphological and genetic data, this paper describes the Iguana populations from Saba and Montserrat as a new species, Iguana melanoderma. This species is recognized on the basis of the following combination of characteristics: private microsatellite alleles, unique mitochondrial ND4 haplotypes, a distinctive black spot between the eye and tympanum, a dorsal carpet pattern on juveniles and young adults, a darkening of body coloration with aging (except for the anterior part of the snout), a black dewlap, pink on the jowl, the high number of large tubercular nape scales, fewer than ten medium sized–triangular dewlap spikes, high dorsal spikes, and lack of horns on the snout. This new melanistic taxon is threatened by unsustainable harvesting (including for the pet trade) and both competition and hybridization from escaped or released invasive alien iguanas (I. iguana iguana and I. rhinolopha) from South and Central America, respectively. The authors call for action to conserve Iguana melanoderma in Saba and Montserrat and for further research to investigate its relationship to other melanistic iguanas from the Virgin Islands and coastal islands of Venezuela.},

Most of the disappearances of crayfish are unexplained. For the 22 others, the main reasons of the disappearance of indigenous crayfish populations were due to (1) habitat destruction by channelisation, (2) decrease of water quality by use of agricultural chemicals, (3) the construction of ponds or lakes changing the physical and chemical parameters of brooks inhabited by indigenous crayfish, (4) the introduction of non-indigenous species, mainly P. leniusculus and recently (5) crayfish plague implicated and characterized in the disappearance of two populations, two additional ones being suspected. Introduced in 1978 in Vienne department, P. leniusculus has now been found in 28 locations.

The spread of feminizing Wolbachia within and across populations is therefore expected to influence mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genetic structure by hitchhiking. To test this hypothesis, we analysed nuclear and mtDNA genetic structure, and Wolbachia prevalence in 13 populations of the pill bug host. Wolbachia prevalence (ranging from 0\% to 100\% of sampled females) was highly variable among populations. All three Wolbachia strains previously observed in A.vulgare were present (wVulC, wVulM and wVulP) with wVulC being the most prevalent (nine of 13 populations). The host showed a genetic structure on five microsatellite loci that is compatible with isolation by distance. The strong genetic structure observed on host mtDNA was correlated with Wolbachia prevalence: three mitotypes were in strong linkage disequilibrium with the three strains of Wolbachia. Neutrality tests showed that the mtDNA polymorphism is not neutral, and we thus suggest that this unusual pattern of mtDNA polymorphism found in A.vulgare was due to Wolbachia.},
